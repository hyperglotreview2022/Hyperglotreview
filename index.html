            <p class="product-short-description1 content">Popular Science has a new storyteller and one who can 
              weave a mesmerizing labyrinth of the banal and even the often neglected aspects of our existence. 
              The leitmotif of his book is an organism's Umwelt --- its 'sensory bubble' or 'perceptual world' --- 
              is both poetic and a recursively hypnotic narrative technique. If Carl Sagan was a master of 
              storytelling about the cosmos, Yong is his successor in the hidden sensory realms around us. 
              He compares tremendous olfactory capabilities of dogs to that of humans in a fascinating way 
              only to debunk the myth that scientific basis for such comparison can be misleading. The vivid 
              description of how crucial pheromones are to the ant's existence makes it almost unputdownable and 
              you find yourself fighting the urge to sleep even at 2 am in the morning. One can almost visualise 
              his lines being read in a documentary with David Attenborough's voiceover. This is his first book, 
              but at the risk of sounding repetitive, like Sagan, Yong evokes the impulse to rush through his book 
              only to pick up his next, or as in the latter case, his previous one. It is difficult to retain the 
              reader's interest, more so, in the popular science genre. For the sake of popular science, one can 
              only hope that the rest of the book matches up to expectations, but, intuitively, it almost seems 
              that Yong has mastered the art of exceeding expectations quite consistently.

            <p class="product-short-description1 content">Janice Pariat's work is a plethora of heartwarming 
              episodes with endearing characters starting with the narrator Shai, her father, Kima and, of 
              course, the indomitable Oiñ. Jaded and with 'no inner compass', Shai travels from the capital 
              fleeing from the air and as revealed through her inner dialogue "because something---I don't 
              know what---has been lost." This raises her mother's suspicions which she finds almost stifling 
              upon arriving home but the hills of Shillong act like a panacea for her existential angst as 
              she starts breathing in the untainted air and soaking up the intermittent but rejuvenating 
              spells of sunlight during her meanderings through the forest. Her father's remarkable knowledge 
              of trees almost verges on a metaphysical connection with nature as he unequivocally propagates 
              that humanity's "gravest crime" is our "plant bias---the tendency to underappreciate or ignore 
              the flora around us". The novel also provides a glimpse of Shillong in a state of transition 
              and how one of its famous rooftop cafés has imitated a design that is reminiscent of a city café 
              instead of adopting the traditional natural aesthetics. Then comes one of the defining moments 
              of the novel, a bildungsroman adventure for Shia who decides to visit Oiñ by embarking on what 
              turns out to be an extremely unnerving prospect for someone who has explored almost nothing of 
              Meghalaya's rural, almost idyllic locales. Pariat is a seasoned writer, yet, her writing is as 
              rejuvenating as the hills of Shillong, free from affections and rich in a mystical exploration 
              of people and their natural environs. </p>

Roy is a noir mystery that takes the readers on a dark and fatalistic journey into a story of lost innocence which is coloured with immense grief. What happens to a father whose child's life is suddenly cut short? Does the final coming together of the pieces of the puzzle bring any sense of closure? Why do we consider murder to be the most unforgiving crime? The Yamuna, groaning with the burden of pollutants, flows through the city of Delhi and the story as the black river. It remains a silent spectator to the crimes that unfold on its banks and on its waters. But do human beings have the capacity to swallow everything like the river? Roy delves into these pertinent questions and charts out a narrative that sheds light on these questions of loss and grief.</p>

              women in her book, Shrayana Bhattacharya places at the centre of it a sociological investigation on 
              the rampant social and economic disparity between men and women.
              Desperately Seeking Shahrukh is an intelligent blend of an empathetic observation of the lives of 
              Indian women and an objective statistical analysis of the gendered nature of our economy. Bhattacharya 
              acknowledges the plurality of the world created in Shah Rukh's films. It is romantic and patriarchal;
               idealistic and regressive. Despite this convergence of seemingly opposing views, women yearn for a 
               man like Shah Rukh for his emotional vulnerability and the lofty romantic standards he sets for his 
               female viewers. Shah Rukh is a representation of their aspirational identity; their quiet pursuit for 
               freedom, vulnerability and equity of treatment in personal and public spheres.

          <p class="product-short-description1 content">Vasudhendra has assayed a novel that is monumental in scale 
            and it takes immense daring to conceive of such a undertaking. The novel oscillates between the backdrop
             of the Tejo in Portugal during the Renaissance and the banks of the Tungabhadra in the Vijaynagara
              Empire. Gabriel and Bella are young lovers caught in the web of an entrenched antisemitic social 
              setting with the economic disparity between their families proving to be as insurmountable an obstacle 
              towards their marriage as much as religious opposition. On the other hand, Belsham and Antonio's 
              friendship is also tested when Queen Isabella of Spain insists upon the forced conversion of the 
              Jewish community for her daughter's marriage with King Manuel. The lovers are caught in the midst 
              of the tumultuous tide that threatens to have a cataclysmic effect on their lives. Humiliated by his 
              beloved's father due to his family's modest economic situation, Gabriel decides to risk his life by 
              embarking on a voyage to India. This is where the scene shifts to the Vijaynagara Empire. One can only 
              wonder that if the setting that was less familiar to the author was presented with such palpable 
              vividness, to what extent will the reader be swept away when the narrative resumes in the historical 
              grandeur of the author's homeland? </p>

          <p class="product-short-description1 content">Translations can often seem tedious due to entrenched cultural
             and linguistic barriers. Amar Mitra's novel is a confluence of resplendent folklore and gruesome 
             socio-political realities. From the first page itself, he has effortlessly imbued the magical realism 
             narrative framework with the ingenuity of a vibrant imagination. The novel proceeds in the form of an
             oddly invigorating cyclical and hypnotical structure moving from one page to the next with the lethargic 
             yet graceful, almost imperceptible movement of a danseuse not even once letting the reader's attention
             wander or slip for even a fraction of a moment. The fisherfolk of Dhanapati's island congregate from the
              months of Ashwin to Chaitra according to the Bengali calendar. Dhanapati is the name of the island,
              as well as of Dhanapati, the oldest inhabitant of the island, and, according to some accounts, that of 
              its first inhabitant though the current Dhanapati vehemently disagrees that there has been anyone else
              before him. Vagabonds like Batashi have a home for six months of the year where they arrive emaciated 
              and then during their stay are rejuvenated in body and spirit turning into voluptuous beings who become
              the object of lustful villainy of the trader Dasharath Singh. The inescapable avarice and corruption of 
              the law enforcers as embodied by the police constable Mangal Midde and the violence inflicted on the
              poor and neglected strays of society is highlighted with razor-sharp precision. It will be difficult to 
              find a voice that is more brutal about socio-economic realities yet so humane while presenting the most 
              heinous atrocities that people nourished and nurtured by the same 
            piece of earth and sky are capable of inflicting upon each other.</p>

          <p class="product-short-description1 content">When an adept marketeer writes books, the result is a book 
            such as 'The Big Bang of Numbers'. Everything from the title itself to the introduction cheekily 
            subtitled "The Poper Made Me Write This Book" promises to be a fascinating read even for a subject 
            that is revered by the millions but billions find intimidating, to put it mildly. For a late bloomer 
            like myself who started appreciating mathematics only after those excruciating experiences with high 
            school algebra, trigonometry and calculus, mathematics now seems to be the forbidden love affair from 
            one's childhood, and adolescence, that could not be consummated due to extraneous factors. So, any new 
            book on the philosophy of science or mathematics is always a means to rekindle that flame reinforced by 
            that sense of hapless nostalgia. As book progresses, the ambitious, albeit unoriginal, project hailed 
            as "creatio ex nihilio" (creation out of nothing) seems to fall way short of expectations. To borrow 
            from Shakespeare's Macbeth, the book ends up being a marketing pitch that is "full of sound and fury" 
            and very little substance. Suri's work seems to have distant echoes of Terence Tao's 'Analysis I', where 
            the latter too undertakes the task of building all the axioms of arithmetic, more precisely, number 
            theory and set theory from the simplest axioms in the first two chapters. To his credit, Suri has 
            changed the order of these two branches of mathematics, making it more accessible to the uninitiated. 
            Here's to hoping that the rest of the book has more substance and doesn't leave a reader who really 
            wanted to like, no, love the book on the subject whose wonders he would've liked to explore during his 
            formative years.</p>

            <p class="product-short-description1 content">A fictional narrative which oscillates between 
              historical accounts, social commentary and a fictional storyline might seem daunting and, 
              perhaps, tedious to some writers. Debarati Mukhopadhyay traverses these seemingly incongruent 
              aspects with effortless ease. The setting changes within a few page from Nobokishore Dutta's 
              compound in Mechhuabajar in Calcutta to Mowshaat, formerly known as Bishwanathpur within the 
              historical backdrop of the latter half of the nineteenth century at a heightened pace of 
              unsettling drama concerning Krishnoshundor's family. The poignancy of Bhubonmoni's excruciating 
              plight is depicted by the judgement she has to face from the male bastions of society who also 
              have the sole right to debate and determine her fate for being raped. The self-appointed standard 
              bearers of morality cannot wait to rid the village of her and, by extension, Krishnoshundor's 
              family because his brother married a heathen. The proposal to save her soul as laid down in the 
              'shaastor' is gratuitously provided by the lecherous Paachkori Mukhopadhyay who wishes to ravage 
              her for thirty nights as penance for her transgression of being violated by non-believers. Only
               then can Bhubonmoni regain her place as a brahmin and be reintegrated into society. Torn between 
               his efforts to ensure that his children are not treated as social pariahs and rescuing his sister 
               from the ravenous intentions of Paachkori, Krishnoshundor envisages the conniving Horihor as 
               heaven sent and falls into his trap. The novel creates a startlingly refreshing displacement 
               of the moral latitude enjoyed by the privileged male members of the times with potent 
               perspicacity. A translation from the original Bengali novel might not capture the depth and 
               scale of the many lives and worlds conceived by the author. Arunava Sinha effortlessly moves 
               between these peripheries effortlessly and demonstrates that in the hands of an adept translator, 
               a wonderful work can occupy similar spaces in the original as in the language of its translation.
