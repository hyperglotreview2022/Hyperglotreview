              <p class="product-short-description content" >The world of Indira Halder is crowded with men and
                 women who are depicted in muted colours. Her painting reminds one of the forgotten art forms of 
                 the marginalised tribal lands. By drawing from these art forms Haldar is able to bring these 
                 otherwise forgotten art into the public eye. She uses subdued colours and white is often a 
                 primary colour.  The subjects of her paintings are ordinary moments like a group of women 
                 gossiping. At times she is inspired by the natural landscape which abounds in animals and 
                 flowers. But haldar’s paintings show a knack for presenting the normal in a peculiar way 
                 which makes her viewers question their own version of reality.

            <p class="product-short-description content" >The compositions of Kuntal Dutta have an air of 
              magical realism. His sources of inspiration are real life things that one would observe every day. 
              He draws houses that are part of a town, a tree, a bird or the moon which is a source of 
              admiration for everyone. Yet the way he portrays these simple objects gives his canvas a 
              magical quality as his brushstrokes are not precise rather they create a haziness which 
              instead of distorting the picture gives it a surreal quality. He uses muted colours to paint 
              this dream like world where everything looks merged together yet everything creates its own
              separate impression. He has a knack for giving a magical quality to the commonplace 
              while making the magical a part of everyday life. In his artistic gaze the magical and 
              the real merge to create a tangible symphony. </p>

        <p class="product-short-description content" >Nature and mankind collapse into each
          other in this piece as this sculpture refers
          both to living breathing objects as well as
          manmade inanimate objects. The iron nails
          form the base of this piece which refers to
          a creature which looks like it is part of the
          moist earth. The metal which changed the
          face of civilizations with its strength is
          combined with the nail whose purpose is to
          hold things together. So what is the purpose
          of these nails which are just hammered in
          at random? The folds of the sculpture part
          to reveal a creature with marks resembling
          a lowly worm. The worm which spends its
          life underground lives and dies an
          unremarkable life yet the combination of
          the iron nails with this creature hints at the
          innate strength and power of even the
          lowliest of creations. The use of earthy tones
          combined with the use of bright red of the
          sun works to symbolize the coming together
          of earth and metal. Together they reflect the
          undeniable force of the elements.</p>

      <p class="product-short-description content" >The compositions of Chandan Das are journeys of self 
        reflection into the shadows of our minds as well as into the light of happiness. His paintings 
        are minimalistic in nature as he does not crowd his canvas with too many things. Yet by using 
        broad brushstrokes, just a few colours and a clever play of light and shadows he is able to depict 
        the various emotions that man goes through with the passage of time. His use of colours is significant 
        as they manifest into various emotions of anger, desire, loss, pain and joy. Many a times he shows
         human mind and soul drowning in the darkest of sensations. But his works eventually evoke a sense 
         of hope as the dichotomy of light and darkness in an individual is not suppressed rather it is 
         celebrated in his art.</p>

              <p class="product-short-description1 content">Translations can often seem tedious due to entrenched cultural
                 and linguistic barriers. Amar Mitra's novel is a confluence of resplendent folklore and gruesome 
                 socio-political realities. From the first page itself, he has effortlessly imbued the magical realism 
                 narrative framework with the ingenuity of a vibrant imagination. The novel proceeds in the form of an
                 oddly invigorating cyclical and hypnotical structure moving from one page to the next with the lethargic 
                 yet graceful, almost imperceptible movement of a danseuse not even once letting the reader's attention
                 wander or slip for even a fraction of a moment. The fisherfolk of Dhanapati's island congregate from the
                  months of Ashwin to Chaitra according to the Bengali calendar. Dhanapati is the name of the island,
                  as well as of Dhanapati, the oldest inhabitant of the island, and, according to some accounts, that of 
                  its first inhabitant though the current Dhanapati vehemently disagrees that there has been anyone else
                  before him. Vagabonds like Batashi have a home for six months of the year where they arrive emaciated 
                  and then during their stay are rejuvenated in body and spirit turning into voluptuous beings who become
                  the object of lustful villainy of the trader Dasharath Singh. The inescapable avarice and corruption of 
                  the law enforcers as embodied by the police constable Mangal Midde and the violence inflicted on the
                  poor and neglected strays of society is highlighted with razor-sharp precision. It will be difficult to 
                  find a voice that is more brutal about socio-economic realities yet so humane while presenting the most 
                  heinous atrocities that people nourished and nurtured by the same 
                piece of earth and sky are capable of inflicting upon each other.</p>

            <p class="preview">Book Preview :</p>
              <p class="product-short-description1 content">Janice Pariat's work is a plethora of heartwarming 
                episodes with endearing characters starting with the narrator Shai, her father, Kima and, of 
                course, the indomitable Oiñ. Jaded and with 'no inner compass', Shai travels from the capital 
                fleeing from the air and as revealed through her inner dialogue "because something---I don't 
                know what---has been lost." This raises her mother's suspicions which she finds almost stifling 
                upon arriving home but the hills of Shillong act like a panacea for her existential angst as 
                she starts breathing in the untainted air and soaking up the intermittent but rejuvenating 
                spells of sunlight during her meanderings through the forest. Her father's remarkable knowledge 
                of trees almost verges on a metaphysical connection with nature as he unequivocally propagates 
                that humanity's "gravest crime" is our "plant bias---the tendency to underappreciate or ignore 
                the flora around us". The novel also provides a glimpse of Shillong in a state of transition 
                and how one of its famous rooftop cafés has imitated a design that is reminiscent of a city café 
                instead of adopting the traditional natural aesthetics. Then comes one of the defining moments 
                of the novel, a bildungsroman adventure for Shia who decides to visit Oiñ by embarking on what 
                turns out to be an extremely unnerving prospect for someone who has explored almost nothing of 
                Meghalaya's rural, almost idyllic locales. Pariat is a seasoned writer, yet, her writing is as 
                rejuvenating as the hills of Shillong, free from affections and rich in a mystical exploration 
                of people and their natural environs. </p>

              His works delve into and empathetically depict the complex emotions and embattled lives of the 
              transgender subjects who, though historically an integral part of Indian society and culture, 
              are seldom recognized as such and rather treated with ambivalence at best and rejection at worst.
