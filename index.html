              <p class="product-short-description1 content">Translations can often seem tedious due to entrenched cultural
                 and linguistic barriers. Amar Mitra's novel is a confluence of resplendent folklore and gruesome 
                 socio-political realities. From the first page itself, he has effortlessly imbued the magical realism 
                 narrative framework with the ingenuity of a vibrant imagination. The novel proceeds in the form of an
                 oddly invigorating cyclical and hypnotical structure moving from one page to the next with the lethargic 
                 yet graceful, almost imperceptible movement of a danseuse not even once letting the reader's attention
                 wander or slip for even a fraction of a moment. The fisherfolk of Dhanapati's island congregate from the
                  months of Ashwin to Chaitra according to the Bengali calendar. Dhanapati is the name of the island,
                  as well as of Dhanapati, the oldest inhabitant of the island, and, according to some accounts, that of 
                  its first inhabitant though the current Dhanapati vehemently disagrees that there has been anyone else
                  before him. Vagabonds like Batashi have a home for six months of the year where they arrive emaciated 
                  and then during their stay are rejuvenated in body and spirit turning into voluptuous beings who become
                  the object of lustful villainy of the trader Dasharath Singh. The inescapable avarice and corruption of 
                  the law enforcers as embodied by the police constable Mangal Midde and the violence inflicted on the
                  poor and neglected strays of society is highlighted with razor-sharp precision. It will be difficult to 
                  find a voice that is more brutal about socio-economic realities yet so humane while presenting the most 
                  heinous atrocities that people nourished and nurtured by the same 
                piece of earth and sky are capable of inflicting upon each other.</p>
