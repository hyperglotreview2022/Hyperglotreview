            <p class="content">Suparna's work showcases an essence of contemporary expressionism. Her works of landscape depict the 
              buildings which are sharp and geometric, the futuristic technology is sleek but textured, the landscape 
              is barren and foreboding often resembling a scene from a dystopian future. Within her inconsequential 
              works, Mandal tries to create parallels between functionality in the cosmic space and the nerve synapses 
              of the human brain rendering in harmonious rhythms.</p>

            <p class="content"><b>Otherworlds</b> explores the complex & exploitative labour and class relationships in Kapashera - a 
              tenement town that lies at the cusp of Delhi and Gurugram. It questions the meaning of home for people 
              in a place that is in a perpetual state of flux and how the temporariness of livelihoods and belonging 
              affects the lives of women in this space. For Otherworlds, Nitin and Sumedha started out by repurposing 
              an old abandoned warehouse in Kapashera to create a space which the women could view as a safe space 
              for daily conversations. Proximity to garment factories meant they had access to a wide range of leftover 
              pieces of cloth in all colours and shapes, and the gendered nature of the chore of sewing comfortably 
              allowed the women to immerse themselves in this activity. What began on the scale of the intimate and 
              domestic, expanded into a larger project when the women started challenging the cadastral map of 
              Kapashera and its patriarchal representation of space. They began to create a 6 metre long and 3 
              metre high tapestry that allowed them to reimagine their own understanding of the space and their 
              ideas of identity, belonging, displacement and loss. </p>

            <p class="content">George Bataille introduced the notion of 'l'informe' - Formlessness.  What Bataille means by 
              Formlessness is that art should be brought down to earth, off of its pedestal where it has been standing 
              since antiquity. For Bataille, creativity is in the process. The Formless, in a way, is abstract and 
              indefinable - Bataille himself claims that a word has no definition. It is performative, rather than 
              explanatory. In this exhibition, it is explored how these artists transcend from form to formlessness 
              in their art. We also get to notice that each artist uses diverse mediums and techniques to define their 
              expressions.</p>

        reflection into the shadows of our minds as well as into the light of happiness. His paintings 
        are minimalistic in nature as he does not crowd his canvas with too many things. Yet by using 
        broad brushstrokes, just a few colours and a clever play of light and shadows he is able to depict 
        the various emotions that man goes through with the passage of time. His use of colours is significant 
        as they manifest into various emotions of anger, desire, loss, pain and joy. Many a times he shows
         human mind and soul drowning in the darkest of sensations. But his works eventually evoke a sense 
         of hope as the dichotomy of light and darkness in an individual is not suppressed rather it is 
         celebrated in his art.</p>

      <p class="product-short-description content" >The canvas for Dipankar Ray becomes a space where stories of 
        the inner mindscape are brought to life. Inspired by nature, his artwork is a celebration of the 
        smallest of creatures which is drawn in the most vivid of colours. While nature and its creations 
        is the object of interest, rapid urbanisation is ever present in the background which raises the larger 
        question of the position of man vis a vis the larger environment. Our innermost thoughts are only a 
        manifestation of our experiences and journeys which in turn are affected by society at large. Ray's
         artistic vision is a revelation of all these thoughts

          <p class="product-short-description1 content">Roy's book opens with a description of a laidback rural 
            space where time has stood still. Untouched by the rapid development in the nearby capital city, 
            Teetarpur in 2017 is revelling in its anonymity and rejoicing the fact that all its inhabitants live 
            an unimaginative life. Clearly this is a place where everyone knows everyone and nothing much 
            happens or is expected to happen. Amidst all this the author introduces the character of Munia, a 
            young girl celebrating her eighth birthday with icecream. In a place where time stands still Munia 
            is an explorer who has created her own world of innocence as well as imagination. But then this is 
            not the story of Munia; rather it is a story of how this spell of time standing still is broken in 
            Teetarpur by a death which shakes the very core of this tiny community. Roy has cleverly created a 
            space where a murder is the least likely thing to happen hence when it happens we are left with 
            several questions and this death certainly wakes everyone out of their slumber. Suddenly the entire 
            community must come to terms with this unnatural death that has occurred and a handful of policemen 
            who are used to sleeping on duty are pushed into rounding up possible suspects and looking for 
            clues. Roy has masterfully weaved a mystery which promises to be a page turner by creating chaos 
            amidst peace. By adding the ingredient of doubt and uncertainty Roy dispels the myth of harmony that 
            surrounds small towns and the readers can look forward to the unmasking of each character.</p>

          <p class="product-short-description1 content">The latest work by the author of 'The Forest of 
            Enchantments' and 'The Last Queen' is set on the cusp of India's independence. The novel begins 
            in the idyllic setting of Ranipur, a village in Bengal 'safe from the rising turbulence in the 
            country'. Nabakumar Ganguly is a doctor who runs a clinic in Calcutta with Dr. Abdullah but the 
            former is facing financial difficulties because of his magnanimity towards poorer clients, much to 
            the disapproval of his pragmatic wife Bina. They should be thinking of the dowry for their three 
            daughters --- Priya, Jamini, and Deepa. The youngest of the three, Priya, idolizes her father and 
            wants to follow in her father's footsteps. Nabakumar's friend Somnath gives him the necessary push 
            to allow her to appear for the exam. Deepa is her mother's favourite and enjoys most of the 
            privileges while Jamini is dutiful, the archetypal less favoured middle child. Chitra Banerjee 
            Divakaruni novel is a homage to Sarat Chandra and 'Sahitya Samrat' Bankim Chandra and yet she 
            manages to navigate through the plot effortlessly with an immediacy that is the hallmark of the 
            greatest writers of our generation. There are numerous Indian writers in English who are great at 
            storytelling but there are few who manage the art with such a deft touch. Even in the bucolic refuge 
            of Ranipur, readers are aware of the ominous and underlying tremors occurring in Calcutta and the 
            rest of the country which will surface soon with cataclysmic consequences. The rest of the novel 
            promises to be a page turner and possibly yet another in the series of Divakaruni's masterpieces. </p>

          <p class="product-short-description1 content">Popular Science has a new storyteller and one who can 
            weave a mesmerizing labyrinth of the banal and even the often neglected aspects of our existence. 
            The leitmotif of his book is an organism's Umwelt --- its 'sensory bubble' or 'perceptual world' --- 
            is both poetic and a recursively hypnotic narrative technique. If Carl Sagan was a master of 
            storytelling about the cosmos, Yong is his successor in the hidden sensory realms around us. 
            He compares tremendous olfactory capabilities of dogs to that of humans in a fascinating way 
            only to debunk the myth that scientific basis for such comparison can be misleading. The vivid 
            description of how crucial pheromones are to the ant's existence makes it almost unputdownable and 
            you find yourself fighting the urge to sleep even at 2 am in the morning. One can almost visualise 
            his lines being read in a documentary with David Attenborough's voiceover. This is his first book, 
            but at the risk of sounding repetitive, like Sagan, Yong evokes the impulse to rush through his book 
            only to pick up his next, or as in the latter case, his previous one. It is difficult to retain the 
            reader's interest, more so, in the popular science genre. For the sake of popular science, one can 
            only hope that the rest of the book matches up to expectations, but, intuitively, it almost seems 
            that Yong has mastered the art of exceeding expectations quite consistently.

              <p class="product-short-description1 content">Janice Pariat's work is a plethora of heartwarming 
                episodes with endearing characters starting with the narrator Shai, her father, Kima and, of 
                course, the indomitable Oiñ. Jaded and with 'no inner compass', Shai travels from the capital 
                fleeing from the air and as revealed through her inner dialogue "because something---I don't 
                know what---has been lost." This raises her mother's suspicions which she finds almost stifling 
                upon arriving home but the hills of Shillong act like a panacea for her existential angst as 
                she starts breathing in the untainted air and soaking up the intermittent but rejuvenating 
                spells of sunlight during her meanderings through the forest. Her father's remarkable knowledge 
                of trees almost verges on a metaphysical connection with nature as he unequivocally propagates 
                that humanity's "gravest crime" is our "plant bias---the tendency to underappreciate or ignore 
                the flora around us". The novel also provides a glimpse of Shillong in a state of transition 
                and how one of its famous rooftop cafés has imitated a design that is reminiscent of a city café 
                instead of adopting the traditional natural aesthetics. Then comes one of the defining moments 
                of the novel, a bildungsroman adventure for Shia who decides to visit Oiñ by embarking on what 
                turns out to be an extremely unnerving prospect for someone who has explored almost nothing of 
                Meghalaya's rural, almost idyllic locales. Pariat is a seasoned writer, yet, her writing is as 
                rejuvenating as the hills of Shillong, free from affections and rich in a mystical exploration 
                of people and their natural environs. </p>

          <p class="product-short-description1 content">While exploring the desires of different strata of Indian 
            women in her book, Shrayana Bhattacharya places at the centre of it a sociological investigation on 
            the rampant social and economic disparity between men and women.
            Desperately Seeking Shahrukh is an intelligent blend of an empathetic observation of the lives of 
            Indian women and an objective statistical analysis of the gendered nature of our economy. Bhattacharya 
            acknowledges the plurality of the world created in Shah Rukh's films. It is romantic and patriarchal;
             idealistic and regressive. Despite this convergence of seemingly opposing views, women yearn for a 
             man like Shah Rukh for his emotional vulnerability and the lofty romantic standards he sets for his 
             female viewers. Shah Rukh is a representation of their aspirational identity; their quiet pursuit for 
             freedom, vulnerability and equity of treatment in personal and public spheres.

        <p class="product-short-description1 content">Vasudhendra has assayed a novel that is monumental in scale 
          and it takes immense daring to conceive of such a undertaking. The novel oscillates between the backdrop
           of the Tejo in Portugal during the Renaissance and the banks of the Tungabhadra in the Vijaynagara
            Empire. Gabriel and Bella are young lovers caught in the web of an entrenched antisemitic social 
            setting with the economic disparity between their families proving to be as insurmountable an obstacle 
            towards their marriage as much as religious opposition. On the other hand, Belsham and Antonio's 
            friendship is also tested when Queen Isabella of Spain insists upon the forced conversion of the 
            Jewish community for her daughter's marriage with King Manuel. The lovers are caught in the midst 
            of the tumultuous tide that threatens to have a cataclysmic effect on their lives. Humiliated by his 
            beloved's father due to his family's modest economic situation, Gabriel decides to risk his life by 
            embarking on a voyage to India. This is where the scene shifts to the Vijaynagara Empire. One can only 
            wonder that if the setting that was less familiar to the author was presented with such palpable 
            vividness, to what extent will the reader be swept away when the narrative resumes in the historical 
            grandeur of the author's homeland? </p>

              <p class="product-short-description1 content">Translations can often seem tedious due to entrenched cultural
                 and linguistic barriers. Amar Mitra's novel is a confluence of resplendent folklore and gruesome 
                 socio-political realities. From the first page itself, he has effortlessly imbued the magical realism 
                 narrative framework with the ingenuity of a vibrant imagination. The novel proceeds in the form of an
                 oddly invigorating cyclical and hypnotical structure moving from one page to the next with the lethargic 
                 yet graceful, almost imperceptible movement of a danseuse not even once letting the reader's attention
                 wander or slip for even a fraction of a moment. The fisherfolk of Dhanapati's island congregate from the
                  months of Ashwin to Chaitra according to the Bengali calendar. Dhanapati is the name of the island,
                  as well as of Dhanapati, the oldest inhabitant of the island, and, according to some accounts, that of 
                  its first inhabitant though the current Dhanapati vehemently disagrees that there has been anyone else
                  before him. Vagabonds like Batashi have a home for six months of the year where they arrive emaciated 
                  and then during their stay are rejuvenated in body and spirit turning into voluptuous beings who become
                  the object of lustful villainy of the trader Dasharath Singh. The inescapable avarice and corruption of 
                  the law enforcers as embodied by the police constable Mangal Midde and the violence inflicted on the
                  poor and neglected strays of society is highlighted with razor-sharp precision. It will be difficult to 
                  find a voice that is more brutal about socio-economic realities yet so humane while presenting the most 
                  heinous atrocities that people nourished and nurtured by the same 
                piece of earth and sky are capable of inflicting upon each other.</p>

        <p class="product-short-description1 content">When an adept marketeer writes books, the result is a book 
          such as 'The Big Bang of Numbers'. Everything from the title itself to the introduction cheekily 
          subtitled "The Poper Made Me Write This Book" promises to be a fascinating read even for a subject 
          that is revered by the millions but billions find intimidating, to put it mildly. For a late bloomer 
          like myself who started appreciating mathematics only after those excruciating experiences with high 
          school algebra, trigonometry and calculus, mathematics now seems to be the forbidden love affair from 
          one's childhood, and adolescence, that could not be consummated due to extraneous factors. So, any new 
          book on the philosophy of science or mathematics is always a means to rekindle that flame reinforced by 
          that sense of hapless nostalgia. As book progresses, the ambitious, albeit unoriginal, project hailed 
          as "creatio ex nihilio" (creation out of nothing) seems to fall way short of expectations. To borrow 
          from Shakespeare's Macbeth, the book ends up being a marketing pitch that is "full of sound and fury" 
          and very little substance. Suri's work seems to have distant echoes of Terence Tao's 'Analysis I', where 
          the latter too undertakes the task of building all the axioms of arithmetic, more precisely, number 
          theory and set theory from the simplest axioms in the first two chapters. To his credit, Suri has 
          changed the order of these two branches of mathematics, making it more accessible to the uninitiated. 
          Here's to hoping that the rest of the book has more substance and doesn't leave a reader who really 
          wanted to like, no, love the book on the subject whose wonders he would've liked to explore during his 
          formative years.</p>

              historical accounts, social commentary and a fictional storyline might seem daunting and, 
              perhaps, tedious to some writers. Debarati Mukhopadhyay traverses these seemingly incongruent 
              aspects with effortless ease. The setting changes within a few pages from Nobokishore Dutta's 
              compound in Mechhuabajar in Calcutta to Mowshaat, formerly known as Bishwanathpur within the 
              historical backdrop of the latter half of the nineteenth century at a heightened pace of 
              unsettling drama concerning Krishnoshundor's family. The poignancy of Bhubonmoni's excruciating 
              plight is depicted by the judgement she has to face from the male bastions of society who also 
              have the sole right to debate and determine her fate for being raped. The self-appointed standard 
              bearers of morality cannot wait to rid the village of her and, by extension, Krishnoshundor's 
              family because his brother married a heathen. The proposal to save her soul as laid down in the 
              'shaastor' is gratuitously provided by the lecherous Paachkori Mukhopadhyay who wishes to ravage 
              her for thirty nights as penance for her transgression of being violated by non-believers. Only
               then can Bhubonmoni regain her place as a brahmin and be reintegrated into society. Torn between 
               his efforts to ensure that his children are not treated as social pariahs and rescuing his sister 
               from the ravenous intentions of Paachkori, Krishnoshundor envisages the conniving Horihor as 
               heaven sent and falls into his trap. The novel creates a startlingly refreshing displacement 
               of the moral latitude enjoyed by the privileged male members of the times with potent 
               perspicacity. A translation from the original Bengali novel might not capture the depth and 
               scale of the many lives and worlds conceived by the author. Arunava Sinha effortlessly moves 
               between these peripheries effortlessly and demonstrates that in the hands of an adept translator, 
               a wonderful work can occupy similar spaces in the original as in the language of its translation.

      <p class="content">The Kochi-Muziris Biennale is an international exhibition of modern art that takes place in Kochi, 
        Kerala, India. It is both the greatest contemporary art festival in Asia and the largest art exhibition in 
        the nation. The Kerala State Government has supported the Kochi Biennale Foundation's proposal. Dr. Venu IAS, 
        the culture secretary for the Keralan government, came up with the idea for the Kochi-Muziris Biennale and 
        carried it out. The exhibition is spread out over Kochi, with performances taking place in already-existing 
        galleries and halls and site-specific works in parks, historic buildings, and abandoned buildings.
        A variety of mediums are incorporated, including cinema, installation, painting, sculpture, new media, and 
        performance art by Indian and international artists.</p>

      <p class="content">Threading the Horizon: Propositions on Worldmaking through Socially Engaged Art Practice foregrounds 
        the quotidian experience of violence experienced by women and gendered others explicated through acts of 
        invisibility, exclusion, inequality and discrimination.  The practices propose a worldmaking within 
        itself, where encounters, engagements, acts and actions generate new cosmologies. A hope for an 
        equitable future emerges in restitution, quietude and vigour of collective action.</p>

      <p class="grey">Into the gathering night: Gopi Gajwani</p>
      <p class="content">Gopi Gajwani's paintings eloquently capture the buoyancy of a colour spoken in whispers, the fluid movement 
        of a stroke made without haste, and the echoing sound of a line suspended in space. His artistic work both 
        affirms the precise correspondences between various sensory perceptions and the idea that each of our senses 
        is capable of more than what is typically expected of them. Over the years, his keen ear has helped us 
        connect to the subtleties of visual music that are masterfully expressed through graphic and tonal notations. 
        Gopi's floaty, delicate, thread-like lines, created with the free hand's kinesthetic rhythm, gently agitate 
        the surface, awakening the stillness with a visual whisper or even an unattached tune.

      <p class="grey">Through Wakefulness, A Night Rising</p>
      <p class="content">The acclaimed Santiniketan pedagogue and artist Benodebehari Mukherjee - whose 
        path-breaking experiments with materials via an integrated approach to art and craft and whose making of 
        a contextual Indian modernism in conversation with international practices were visionary developments 
        as a result of his life's work - ironically grappled with declining vision from a young age. With 
        complete blindness in one eye and myopic sight in the other, Mukherjee could not hope for a traditional 
        education in his childhood.  
        For Treibor Mawlong, an emerging artist from the Khasi hills of Meghalaya, people's relationships to 
        nature and its elements are as personal and potent as they are to each other. Theirs is a closed-circuit 
        world nurtured by the pride of belonging, inner revolution and necessitated self-sufficiency. Guided by 
        autobiographical events, Mawlong relies on a kind of telescopic observation - first separating, 
        then internalizing - to depict larger stories about the human condition, which he explores in 
        expressionistic frames of passion, honor, love, pride, grief, loss and change.

      <p class="grey">l'informe</p>
      <p class="content">George Bataille introduced the notion of 'l'informe' - Formlessness.  What Bataille 
        means by Formlessness is that art should be brought down to earth, off of its pedestal where it has 
        been standing since antiquity. For Bataille, creativity is in the process. The Formless, in a way, is 
        abstract and indefinable - Bataille himself claims that a word has no definition. It is performative, 
        rather than explanatory. In this exhibition, it is explored how these artists transcend from form to 
        formlessness in their art. We also get to notice that each artist uses diverse mediums and techniques to 
        define their expressions.

      <p class="grey">Adrift and At Sea</p>
      <p class="content">Reimagining the meaning of being 'adrift at sea, Devika Sundar presents the 
        internal expanse of the human body as aqueous forms that are unbound and untethered. In doing so, she 
        brings out the uncanny echoes between us and bodies of water, in the way that they can be imaged, 
        heard, and understood. This mode of enquiry emerged from Sundar's experiences with undiagnosed chronic 
        pain and the research that it led to on the differences between medical visualisations in the East and 
        the West. Sundar found holistic representations that account for the body's ebbs and flows to provide 
        better insight into the mysteries of its functioning in comparison with the fragmentation of the body 
        into parts and symptoms as is standard in Western medicine. Sundar's research also reinforced the 
        comfort that she had always experienced in the water as a place where the body felt held and where pain 
        momentarily subsided.
