                  His works delve into and empathetically depict the complex emotions and embattled lives of the 
                  transgender subjects who, though historically an integral part of Indian society and culture,

                  in the face of public fear, revulsion, and ridicule, they have heroically struggled to carve out a 
                  niche for themselves in this brutally indifferent world with atypical and exemplary pride, boldness,
                    dignity and confidence. Saha paintings thus bring forth their zest for life and quest for respect
                    and acceptance against all odds.</p>

              <p class="product-short-description content" >The world of Indira Halder is crowded with men and
                 women who are depicted in muted colours. Her painting reminds one of the forgotten art forms of 
                 the marginalised tribal lands. By drawing from these art forms Haldar is able to bring these 
                 otherwise forgotten art into the public eye. She uses subdued colours and white is often a 
                 primary colour.  The subjects of her paintings are ordinary moments like a group of women 
                 gossiping. At times she is inspired by the natural landscape which abounds in animals and 
                 flowers. But haldarâ€™s paintings show a knack for presenting the normal in a peculiar way 
                 which makes her viewers question their own version of reality.

              magical realism. His sources of inspiration are real life things that one would observe every day. 
              He draws houses that are part of a town, a tree, a bird or the moon which is a source of 
              admiration for everyone. Yet the way he portrays these simple objects gives his canvas a 
              magical quality as his brushstrokes are not precise rather they create a haziness which 
              instead of distorting the picture gives it a surreal quality. He uses muted colours to paint 
              this dream like world where everything looks merged together yet everything creates its own
              separate impression. He has a knack for giving a magical quality to the commonplace 
              while making the magical a part of everyday life. In his artistic gaze the magical and 
              the real merge to create a tangible symphony. </p>

          other in this piece as this sculpture refers
          both to living breathing objects as well as
          manmade inanimate objects. The iron nails
          form the base of this piece which refers to
          a creature which looks like it is part of the
          moist earth. The metal which changed the
          face of civilizations with its strength is
          combined with the nail whose purpose is to
          hold things together. So what is the purpose
          of these nails which are just hammered in
          at random? The folds of the sculpture part
          to reveal a creature with marks resembling
          a lowly worm. The worm which spends its
          life underground lives and dies an
          unremarkable life yet the combination of
          the iron nails with this creature hints at the
          innate strength and power of even the
          lowliest of creations. The use of earthy tones
          combined with the use of bright red of the
          sun works to symbolize the coming together
          of earth and metal. Together they reflect the

        reflection into the shadows of our minds as well as into the light of happiness. His paintings 
        are minimalistic in nature as he does not crowd his canvas with too many things. Yet by using 
        broad brushstrokes, just a few colours and a clever play of light and shadows he is able to depict 
        the various emotions that man goes through with the passage of time. His use of colours is significant 
        as they manifest into various emotions of anger, desire, loss, pain and joy. Many a times he shows
         human mind and soul drowning in the darkest of sensations. But his works eventually evoke a sense 
         of hope as the dichotomy of light and darkness in an individual is not suppressed rather it is 
         celebrated in his art.</p>

        the inner mindscape are brought to life. Inspired by nature, his artwork is a celebration of the 
        smallest of creatures which is drawn in the most vivid of colours. While nature and its creations 
        is the object of interest, rapid urbanisation is ever present in the background which raises the larger 
        question of the position of man vis a vis the larger environment. Our innermost thoughts are only a 
        manifestation of our experiences and journeys which in turn are affected by society at large. Ray's
         artistic vision is a revelation of all these thoughts

              <p class="product-short-description1 content">Translations can often seem tedious due to entrenched cultural
                 and linguistic barriers. Amar Mitra's novel is a confluence of resplendent folklore and gruesome 
                 socio-political realities. From the first page itself, he has effortlessly imbued the magical realism 
                 narrative framework with the ingenuity of a vibrant imagination. The novel proceeds in the form of an
                 oddly invigorating cyclical and hypnotical structure moving from one page to the next with the lethargic 
                 yet graceful, almost imperceptible movement of a danseuse not even once letting the reader's attention
                 wander or slip for even a fraction of a moment. The fisherfolk of Dhanapati's island congregate from the
                  months of Ashwin to Chaitra according to the Bengali calendar. Dhanapati is the name of the island,
                  as well as of Dhanapati, the oldest inhabitant of the island, and, according to some accounts, that of 
                  its first inhabitant though the current Dhanapati vehemently disagrees that there has been anyone else
                  before him. Vagabonds like Batashi have a home for six months of the year where they arrive emaciated 
                  and then during their stay are rejuvenated in body and spirit turning into voluptuous beings who become
                  the object of lustful villainy of the trader Dasharath Singh. The inescapable avarice and corruption of 
                  the law enforcers as embodied by the police constable Mangal Midde and the violence inflicted on the
                  poor and neglected strays of society is highlighted with razor-sharp precision. It will be difficult to 
                  find a voice that is more brutal about socio-economic realities yet so humane while presenting the most 
                  heinous atrocities that people nourished and nurtured by the same 
                piece of earth and sky are capable of inflicting upon each other.</p>

              <p class="product-short-description1 content">Janice Pariat's work is a plethora of heartwarming 
                episodes with endearing characters starting with the narrator Shai, her father, Kima and, of 
                course, the indomitable OiÃ±. Jaded and with 'no inner compass', Shai travels from the capital 
                fleeing from the air and as revealed through her inner dialogue "because something---I don't 
                know what---has been lost." This raises her mother's suspicions which she finds almost stifling 
                upon arriving home but the hills of Shillong act like a panacea for her existential angst as 
                she starts breathing in the untainted air and soaking up the intermittent but rejuvenating 
                spells of sunlight during her meanderings through the forest. Her father's remarkable knowledge 
                of trees almost verges on a metaphysical connection with nature as he unequivocally propagates 
                that humanity's "gravest crime" is our "plant bias---the tendency to underappreciate or ignore 
                the flora around us". The novel also provides a glimpse of Shillong in a state of transition 
                and how one of its famous rooftop cafÃ©s has imitated a design that is reminiscent of a city cafÃ© 
                instead of adopting the traditional natural aesthetics. Then comes one of the defining moments 
                of the novel, a bildungsroman adventure for Shia who decides to visit OiÃ± by embarking on what 
                turns out to be an extremely unnerving prospect for someone who has explored almost nothing of 
                Meghalaya's rural, almost idyllic locales. Pariat is a seasoned writer, yet, her writing is as 
                rejuvenating as the hills of Shillong, free from affections and rich in a mystical exploration 
                of people and their natural environs. </p>

            <p class="product-short-description1 content">A fictional narrative which oscillates between 
              historical accounts, social commentary and a fictional storyline might seem daunting and, 
              perhaps, tedious to some writers. Debarati Mukhopadhyay traverses these seemingly incongruent 
              aspects with effortless ease. The setting changes within a few pages from Nobokishore Dutta's 
              compound in Mechhuabajar in Calcutta to Mowshaat, formerly known as Bishwanathpur within the 
              historical backdrop of the latter half of the nineteenth century at a heightened pace of 
              unsettling drama concerning Krishnoshundor's family. The poignancy of Bhubonmoni's excruciating 
              plight is depicted by the judgement she has to face from the male bastions of society who also 
              have the sole right to debate and determine her fate for being raped. The self-appointed standard 
              bearers of morality cannot wait to rid the village of her and, by extension, Krishnoshundor's 
              family because his brother married a heathen. The proposal to save her soul as laid down in the 
              'shaastor' is gratuitously provided by the lecherous Paachkori Mukhopadhyay who wishes to ravage 
              her for thirty nights as penance for her transgression of being violated by non-believers. Only
               then can Bhubonmoni regain her place as a brahmin and be reintegrated into society. Torn between 
               his efforts to ensure that his children are not treated as social pariahs and rescuing his sister 
               from the ravenous intentions of Paachkori, Krishnoshundor envisages the conniving Horihor as 
               heaven sent and falls into his trap. The novel creates a startlingly refreshing displacement 
               of the moral latitude enjoyed by the privileged male members of the times with potent 
               perspicacity. A translation from the original Bengali novel might not capture the depth and 
               scale of the many lives and worlds conceived by the author. Arunava Sinha effortlessly moves 
               between these peripheries effortlessly and demonstrates that in the hands of an adept translator, 
               a wonderful work can occupy similar spaces in the original as in the language of its translation.

        <p class="product-short-description1 content">While exploring the desires of different strata of Indian 
          women in her book, Shrayana Bhattacharya places at the centre of it a sociological investigation on 
          the rampant social and economic disparity between men and women.
          Desperately Seeking Shahrukh is an intelligent blend of an empathetic observation of the lives of 
          Indian women and an objective statistical analysis of the gendered nature of our economy. Bhattacharya 
          acknowledges the plurality of the world created in Shah Rukh's films. It is romantic and patriarchal;
           idealistic and regressive. Despite this convergence of seemingly opposing views, women yearn for a 
           man like Shah Rukh for his emotional vulnerability and the lofty romantic standards he sets for his 
           female viewers. Shah Rukh is a representation of their aspirational identity; their quiet pursuit for 
           freedom, vulnerability and equity of treatment in personal and public spheres.

      <p class="product-short-description1 content">When an adept marketeer writes books, the result is a book 
        such as 'The Big Bang of Numbers'. Everything from the title itself to the introduction cheekily 
        subtitled "The Poper Made Me Write This Book" promises to be a fascinating read even for a subject 
        that is revered by the millions but billions find intimidating, to put it mildly. For a late bloomer 
        like myself who started appreciating mathematics only after those excruciating experiences with high 
        school algebra, trigonometry and calculus, mathematics now seems to be the forbidden love affair from 
        one's childhood, and adolescence, that could not be consummated due to extraneous factors. So, any new 
        book on the philosophy of science or mathematics is always a means to rekindle that flame reinforced by 
        that sense of hapless nostalgia. As book progresses, the ambitious, albeit unoriginal, project hailed 
        as "creatio ex nihilio" (creation out of nothing) seems to fall way short of expectations. To borrow 
        from Shakespeare's Macbeth, the book ends up being a marketing pitch that is "full of sound and fury" 
        and very little substance. Suri's work seems to have distant echoes of Terence Tao's 'Analysis I', where 
        the latter too undertakes the task of building all the axioms of arithmetic, more precisely, number 
        theory and set theory from the simplest axioms in the first two chapters. To his credit, Suri has 
        changed the order of these two branches of mathematics, making it more accessible to the uninitiated. 
        Here's to hoping that the rest of the book has more substance and doesn't leave a reader who really 
        wanted to like, no, love the book on the subject whose wonders he would've liked to explore during his 
        formative years.</p>

      <p class="grey">Once around the Sun, Treibor Mawlong</p>
      <p class="content"> The acclaimed Santiniketan pedagogue and artist Benodebehari Mukherjee - whose path-breaking 
        experiments with materials via an integrated approach to art and craft and whose making of a contextual 
        Indian modernism in conversation with international practices were visionary developments as a result of 
        his life's work - ironically grappled with declining vision from a young age. With complete blindness in 
        one eye and myopic sight in the other, Mukherjee could not hope for a traditional education in his 
        childhood.  
        For Treibor Mawlong, an emerging artist from the Khasi hills of Meghalaya, people's relationships to 
        nature and its elements are as personal and potent as they are to each other. Theirs is a closed-circuit 
        world nurtured by the pride of belonging, inner revolution and necessitated self-sufficiency. Guided by 
        autobiographical events, Mawlong relies on a kind of telescopic observation - first separating, then 
        internalizing - to depict larger stories about the human condition, which he explores in expressionistic 
        frames of passion, honor, love, pride, grief, loss and change.</p>
