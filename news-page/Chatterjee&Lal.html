    Mortimer Chatterjee and Tara Lal, a husband and wife duo, established Chatterjee & Lal in 2003. The gallery, 
    which is now located in Mumbai's Colaba art district, is a prominent hub in the city's developing art scene. 
    While the gallery has always placed a strong emphasis on the work of emerging artists, more recent 
    programming has included historical content that expands our understanding of the histories of art and 
    design in the twentieth century.

  <p><b>Artists in Focus:</b> Arshi Irshad Ahmadzai, Minam Apang, Nikhil Chopra, Amshu Chukki, Shanti Dave, 
    Naveen Kishore, Kausik Mukhopadhyay, Sahej Rahal, Nelly Sethna, Gagan Singh, Rustom Siodia, and 
    Nityan Unnikrishnan. </p>

      <h3>Shanti Dave</h3>
    <img class="artist-page-img" src="../news-img/Chatterjee1.jpg" alt="events image">
    <p class="credit">Image Credit - Chatterjee & Lal</p>
    <p>Dave is renowned for both his paintings and his expansive murals, which are displayed in galleries and 
      public areas all around the world. Some of his murals can be found in the VIP lounge at a New York airport 
      as well as in the Air India offices in London, New York, Frankfurt, and Sydney. As may be observed from 
      his use of formal abstraction, Dave was a modernist, unlike most other artists of his day. He places 
      more of an emphasis on the medium and its potential than on incorporating ideological themes into his 
      works. Later, he made a conscious decision to favour printmaking, drawn to the medium both for the broader 
      democratic character it afforded both the artist and the client as well as for the potential for richer 
      textures. Dave is renowned for his experiments using encaustic, in addition to oil, to produce high relief 
      paintings. </p>

      <h3>Minam Apang</h3>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../news-img/Chatterjee2.jpg" alt="events image">
    <p class="credit">Image Credit - Chatterjee & Lal</p>
    <p>Arunachal Pradesh-born visual artist Minam Apang. Her works have been displayed on numerous worldwide 
      stages. In Mumbai, where she first started exhibiting her works at a gallery, she has had four solo 
      exhibitions. She divides her time between sketching, farming, and music-making while residing in Goa 
      and Arunachal Pradesh.Minam Apang uses ink and charcoal to create her abstract landscapes and allusions 
      to regional folklore. Although the principal subjects of her early work were mythology and popular tales, 
      she eventually developed an interest in the psychological reaction of familiarity and recognition to an 
      image.
    </p>

    <h3>Sahej Rahal</h3>
    <img class="artist-page-img" src="../news-img/Chatterjee3.jpg" alt="events image">
    <p class="credit">Image Credit - Chatterjee & Lal</p>
    <p>His body of work is a developing narrative that uses mythical creatures and engages them in discourse 
      with contemporary life. In these stories, these beings execute bizarre activities in abandoned areas of 
      the city, transforming them into liminal ritual grounds. The temporal act and its aftermath are the main 
      motifs in his work. 
      "My paintings are pages of a fragmented, quasi-historical manuscript that functions as an absurd 
      encyclopedia of a fictional civilisation. The pages of this encyclopedia grow in the manner of Borges's 
      The Book of Sand, with each page of the manuscript iteratively cataloguing the creatures that roam the 
      civilisation, charting their origins, customs, rituals, and myths."</p>

      <h3>Arshi Irshad Ahmadzai</h3>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../news-img/Chatterjee4.jpg" alt="events image">
    <p class="credit">Image Credit - Chatterjee & Lal</p>
    <p>Arshi has produced work that ranges in scale and medium and addresses a wide variety of issues. 
      Arshi creates work that combines words and images in a way that at times may be reminiscent of fragments 
      of ancient writings and at other times may be similar to deeply personal journals, all the while 
      criticising the position, agency, and lack thereof, of the Muslim woman. In her project Lihaaf (2020), 
      which was constructed by numerous women in her hometown of Najibabad as a huge quilt, Arshi discusses 
      the verbal and emotional interactions that happen when women collaborate. Although her fundamental 
      concerns and inquiries as an artist have, to a significant extent, stayed constant over the years, 
      Arshi has handled her concerns from a variety of angles, each one unique to her position as a South 
      Asian Muslim woman.
