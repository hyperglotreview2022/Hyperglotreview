   <h2>The Immortal King Rao (Vauhini Vara)</h2>
   <h4>Early Review</h4>
   <p class="disclaimer">This review is the initial impression of our editorial team after reading approximately one-tenth of the book. </p>
   <p class="disclaimer">DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed in the Early Review might not necessarily have a correlation with the Final Review of the book. </p>
    <p class="book-info contents">The latest work by the author of 'The Forest of Enchantments' and 'The Last Queen' is 
      set on the cusp of India's independence. The novel begins in the idyllic setting of Ranipur, a village in 
      Bengal 'safe from the rising turbulence in the country'. Nabakumar Ganguly is a doctor who runs a clinic 
      in Calcutta with Dr. Abdullah but the former is facing financial difficulties because of his magnanimity 
      towards poorer clients, much to the disapproval of his pragmatic wife Bina. They should be thinking of the 
      dowry for their three daughters --- Priya, Jamini, and Deepa. The youngest of the three, Priya, 
      idolizes her father and wants to follow in her father's footsteps. Nabakumar's friend Somnath gives him 
      the necessary push to allow her to appear for the exam. Deepa is her mother's favourite and enjoys most 
      of the privileges while Jamini is dutiful, the archetypal less favoured middle child. Chitra Banerjee 
      Divakaruni novel is a homage to Sarat Chandra and 'Sahitya Samrat' Bankim Chandra and yet she manages 
      to navigate through the plot effortlessly with an immediacy that is the hallmark of the greatest writers 
      of our generation. There are numerous Indian writers in English who are great at storytelling but there 
      are few who manage the art with such a deft touch. Even in the bucolic refuge of Ranipur, readers are 
      aware of the ominous and underlying tremors occurring in Calcutta and the rest of the country which will 
      surface soon with cataclysmic consequences. The rest of the novel promises to be a page turner and 
      possibly yet another in the series of Divakaruni's masterpieces.

    <!-- <p class="extracontent">    
      The story begins with a vivid portrayal of a serene rural town where time seems to have come to a standstill. While the nearby capital city experiences rapid growth and change, Teetarpur remains anonymous and its inhabitants take solace in the mundane routines of their unimaginative lives. The author has crafted a seemingly idyllic paradise, where a murder would be the furthest thing from anyone's mind. So when a death occurs, it shatters the peace and raises many unanswered questions that rouses everyone from a state of listless slumber. Out of nowhere, chaos descends upon the community, disrupting the delicate balance of their lives. The entire town is forced to confront the unnatural tragedy that has befallen its residents. A small group of lethargic policemen are suddenly thrust into the spotlight, tasked with the arduous tasks of rounding up suspects and collecting evidence. Readers are taken on a thrilling journey of discovery, which leads to peeling back the layers of each character and revealing the truth behind the murder, in no small measure comparable to an intricately dramatic study of a police procedural. <br> <br>

      Crime fiction has often been a means of conveying socio-political commentary, and Nilanjana Roy's Black River is no exception. While the murder in the novel is shocking, the aftermath is even more unsettling. The crime disrupts the daily lives of characters like Chand, causing them to reflect on the past, while others like Rabia are forced to confront harsh realities they had been ignoring. Chaos has a way of revealing uncomfortable truths, and the novel meticulously follows this pattern. It presents a series of moments that expose harsh realities about life in one of the world's largest democracies and holds up a mirror to its readers, forcing them to rethink their position and place in Indian society. The work is interspersed with references to socio-historical events, with one such event being the Babri Masjid demolition. The narrative highlights the socio-political climate in which we live and forces readers to confront questions that they may have previously avoided. The novel also tackles issues such as mental illness, the plight of slum dwellers, Islamophobia, farmer's rights, women's safety, and the divide between the haves and have-nots. These issues are often dismissed by readers as being outside of their everyday reality, but the murder in the novel has a seismic effect, creating a ripple of uncomfortable questions for both the characters and the readers. <br> <br>

      The characters of Chand, Rabia, Badshah Miyan, and village sub-inspector Ombir Singh are well-rounded, and readers become invested in each character's journey throughout the narrative as the author weaves their lives together. We are afforded a glimpse into the emotional journey of the family left behind by the victim. Similarly, we also become voyeurs into the tumultuous life of the investigating officer, who is struggling with his own personal demons as he grapples with accusations of infertility and a marriage in shambles. As is common in police procedural novels, Ombir Singh must navigate a tangled web of political pressure and corruption. The plight of those who are relegated to the lowest rung of society, such as the initial suspect, who is dismissed even by the villagers gains considerable magnitude during the course of the narrative as his story turns into a harrowing tale of horror and loss, becoming one of the most compelling character arcs in the book. <br> <br>

      The latest novel from Roy forces us to wrestle with the concept of justice and examine the limits of mercy. By the end of the novel, we might even question our own assumptions about morality and justice, but the author accomplishes this feat in quite an adept manner, allowing readers to arrive at their own conclusions. Roy's matter-of-fact approach to sensitive issues and her success in avoiding a sententious tone enhances the potency of her message. She has accomplished to weave an extremely complex narrative web with the use of simple, unadorned language and that underscores the power of the narrative itself. Black River is all set to be recognised as one of the benchmarks of crime fiction, and, in particular, noir mysteries of our times.

      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p class="contents">Set during the partition of British India in 1947, a time when neighbor was pitted against neighbor and families were torn apart, award-winning author Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's novel brings to life the sweeping story of three sisters caught up in events beyond their control, their unbreakable bond, and their incredible struggle against powerful odds.

        India, 1947.
        
        In a rural village in Bengal live three sisters, daughters of a well-respected doctor.
        
        Priya: intelligent and idealistic, resolved to follow in her father's footsteps and become a doctor, though society frowns on it.
        
        Deepa: the beauty, determined to make a marriage that will bring her family joy and status.
        
        Jamini: devout, sharp-eyed, and a talented quiltmaker, with deeper passions than she reveals.
        
        Theirs is a home of love and safety, a refuge from the violent events taking shape in the nation. Then their father is killed during a riot, and even their neighbors turn against them, bringing the events of their country closer to home.
        
        As Priya determinedly pursues her career goal, Deepa falls deeply in love with a Muslim, causing her to break with her family. And Jamini attempts to hold her family together, even as she secretly longs for her sister's fiancè
        
        When the partition of India is officially decided, a drastic—and dangerous—change is in the air. India is now for Hindus, Pakistan for Muslims. The sisters find themselves separated from one another, each on different paths. They fear for what will happen to not just themselves, but each other.
        
        Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni outdoes herself with this deeply moving story of sisterhood and friendship, painting an account of India's independence simultaneously exhilarating and devastating, that will make any reader—new or old—a devoted fan.</p>
