        <p class="contents1">Emami Art is a leading contemporary art gallery and space for cultural production.

          Emami Art represents emerging, mid-career and established contemporary artists. The gallery also has a dynamic programme of wide-ranging registers of exhibitions.

        <p class="contents1">Experimenter was co-founded by Prateek & Priyanka Raja in 2009 in Kolkata, India. With a multidisciplinary approach, the gallery is an incubator for an ambitious and challenging contemporary practice. The program represents some of the most critical contemporary artists worldwide. The program, rooted in dialogue and dissent, is considered to be a 'pace-setter' for its region, and extends from exhibition-making to knowledge creation, through regular talks, performances, workshops and through its much acclaimed, annual curatorial intensive - Experimenter Curators' Hub. A second, more ambitious space was added in 2018, marking a deeper inquisition into the gallery's realm of interest. Its third space Experimenter Colaba, established in 2022, marks the commitment of its discursive programming to Mumbai, a city that in turn represents the diverse pluralities of the region.


          The gallery attempts to expand the scope of contemporary practice beyond the ambit of its expected role. In 2016, its artist-book publishing wing was launched followed by the Experimenter Learning Program in 2018 which enables learning in fields of contemporary and performing arts, curatorship, film, writing, language and social culture. In 2019, Experimenter Outpost, an iterative exhibitions program outside the physical gallery temporarily inhabiting disused, characterful spaces was formed. 2020 marked the beginning of Experimenter Labs, an inclusive, experimental and multi- dimensional online platform in addition to the onsite gallery programming.

        <p class="contents1">Gallery Espace was established in New Delhi in 1989 by Renu Modi with the encouragement of M F Husain who also designed its distinctive galloping horse logo. The legendary painter was a friend of the Modis, one of India's foremost industrialists with a rich history of contribution in nation-building; in the mid-1980s, he also designed the Modi family home in New Delhi, which remains his only sculptural installation*. Spurred by her friendship with Husain, Manjit Bawa and other artists, Mrs Modi found herself drawn into the world of Indian art. And when Husain spoke of the need for professionally run galleries in the then rapidly growing Indian art market, she decided to take the plunge. 

          Gallery Espace opened its doors in October 1989 with a show of autobiographical works* by Husain. It was located in a small boardroom of a corporate office in New Delhi's upscale New Friends Colony market. Three decades on, it continues to occupy the same address though it is now a two tiered space with state-of-the-art lighting and display systems.

Also the gallery engages in programs to enhance art knowledge amongst young artists as well as young collectors by way of conducting talks and interviews of established contemporary artists.

We are committed to promoting ideas around contemporary art and critical thought within Ahmedabad, a city entrenched in cultural history, but without, until now, a strong contemporary art presence. It is our mission to set a global benchmark, considering best practices and supportive holistic programming to showcase local emerging talent along with Indian and International artists so that our community of artists, collectors, and art lovers have space within their own city to learn, discover and engage. We aim to create value and make a difference through showing a global standard of artworks, established and emerging and working with various stakeholders to create an ongoing curation of annual programming, both at our physical space in Ahmedabad, as well as online channels and with temporary multicity presence through art fairs and temporary exhibitions.

        <p class="contents1">Since 2010, LATITUDE 28 has probed into new gallery practice, one that is lateral, disruptive and avant-garde. Discerning emerging artists making their mark in the Indian Subcontinent including Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka and beyond such as Iran, LATITUDE 28’s artists respond to the critical conversations of our times or the annals of their surreal imaginations. LATITUDE 28 has stimulated artists, writers, critics, researchers and curators to experiment with medium, material, dialogue, perspective and practice while fostering collectors, art enthusiasts and takers of a new era. These maker-market relationships have grown through the gallery's interactive incubation space, where ideas have been generated through curatorial projects within art history and socio-political contexts, site-specific artworks and artist talks. The gallery makes art accessible and inclusive with exhibitions located at the intersection of artists, art institutions, collectors and many different publics. With its critical writing on contemporary art through TAKE on Art Magazine, it has supported cutting-edge content, critical writing ensembles, workshops and awards for new writers. LATITUDE 28's vision is shaped by its Founder/Director, Bhavna Kakar, who is also the founder and editor of TAKE on Art – South Asia's leading contemporary art publication.

Shrine Empire's community includes a large network of local and international partners, and in collaboration, the gallery contributes to building discourse on contemporary art in South Asia through discussions, artist talks, workshops and patronage. For the past several years, the gallery extended its outreach programs to build a strong base for the arts locally through sustained educational initiatives and by supporting alternative practices. In 2017 these initiatives were formally consolidated as the not-for-profit initiative, Prameya Art Foundation.

Guided by connoisseur and self-taught artist, Kalpana Shah, it has seen the art market in all its highs and lows. From the days when the gallery's walls were resplendent with the works of Indian Masters like Hussain, Raza, and Tyeb Mehta in the early 2000's, to recovery after the financial crisis with a new younger crop of artists, Tao has experienced many waves of change. 
          In its 20-year history, Tao has curated uniquely conceptualized shows highlighting diverse art forms like painting, photography, sculpture, video, performance as well as installation arts in its two exhibition galleries. The Gallery is very open-minded towards any creative expression and emphasizes on the powerful and innovative presentation of artistic ability, building a thought provoking experience for all its viewers and inviting dialogue on culture, aesthetics and the tradition of visual arts. Tao has also been actively involved in publishing various art books and organizing art education workshops, interactive sessions with artists and other knowledge-based lectures that aim to propagate love for art, and boost the presence of Indian Art in the global arena. Tao's macro-vision sees art not in isolation, but as having a cohesive relationship with life itself.
