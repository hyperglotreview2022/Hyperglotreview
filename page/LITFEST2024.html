        <div class="art-topic tag">LIT FEST 2024</div>

        <p>Poetry, and by extension, art inherently eludes definition. What one might say poetry or art is today becomes its antithesis tomorrow and returns as its own antithesis like the eternal recurrence or the ‘wheel of time’ experienced by the universe itself. “Drishtaphala [visible fruits] like banners or
          material rewards do not indicate success of a play production. Real success is achieved when the play is performed with skilled precision, devoted faith and concentration. To succeed, the artist must immerse the spectator with pure joy of rasa experience. The spectator's concentrated absorption and
          appreciation is success.”</p>
