          Kalabimb-24 is an exhibition of the finest works from 24 well established artists from all over India, showcasing the diverse and dynamic expressions of contemporary art. This year's collection bringstogether a vibrant array of artists, each pushing the boundaries of creativity through innovative techniques and thought-provoking themes.<br/>
          Finetouch Art Motivators & Educators (FAME) conceiving with a view to encourage a rejuvenation of spirit within the visual art community. Art is an expression of emotion and the feeling deep within one's heart. We thought that all art enthusiasts may enjoy and at the same time provide an added avenue for the artists to show their works in their visual languages as Paintings, Digital, Photographs and mix media.<br/>
          Indian art continually stirred by a long history of engagement with the practice of making art and of facing complex relationships with forces from within and beyond the country. Intense migration, exceptional mixture, precocious mastery, devotion to image and commitment to its critique, and a sentimental affection for the folk and the curiosity to mediate the western and modern - these are only some of the contexts of the art of the current time and these likewise implicate the currency of recognition as Indian art circulates quite actively in the region and elsewhere.<br/>
          The diversity of Indian art became more robust by permeated artistic practice and cut across the realms of the personal and the political. The state of the earth, the position of women in society, the changing landscape of cities, the vexing spectre of identity were some of the most cogent themes and concerns informing the work of artists.<br/>
          "FAME" curate group exhibitions in which artists revolves around the theme of "Interconnected Realities." In an era where the digital and physical realms increasingly intersect, this exhibition explores how artists navigate and merge these spaces. The artworks featured interrogate the complexities of identity, technology, and environment, reflecting the multifaceted experiences of our contemporary world.</p>

They sway in a drunken ecstasy, mirroring the joyous abandon of the divine. Every blossom, with its unique beauty, whispers of Krishna's presence, inviting the beholder to join the eternal quest for
          enlightenment.
          As the gopis were bewitched by Krishna's charm, so too are our eyes ensnared by the enchanting allure of nature's splendor. In the intricate tapestry of petals and stems, we glimpse the eternal dance of creation, where war and peace converge in a symphony of harmonious contradiction.
