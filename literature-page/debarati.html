      <h2>Debarati Mukhopadhyay</h2>
      <h4>Early Review</h4>
    <p class="disclaimer">This review is the initial impression of our editorial team after reading approximately one-tenth of the book. </p>
    <p class="disclaimer">DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed in the Early Review might not necessarily have a correlation with the Final Review of the book. </p>
    <p class="book-info content">A fictional narrative which traverses between 
      historical accounts, social commentary and a fictional storyline might seem daunting and, 
      perhaps, tedious to some writers. Debarati Mukhopadhyay traverses these seemingly incongruent 
      aspects with effortless ease. The setting changes within a few pages from Nobokishore Dutta's 
      compound in Mechhuabajar in Calcutta to Mowshaat, formerly known as Bishwanathpur within the 
      historical backdrop of the latter half of the nineteenth century at a heightened pace of 
      unsettling drama concerning Krishnoshundor's family. The poignancy of Bhubonmoni's excruciating 
      plight is depicted by the judgement she has to face from the male bastions of society who also 
      have the sole right to debate and determine her fate for being raped. The self-appointed standard 
      bearers of morality cannot wait to rid the village of her and, by extension, Krishnoshundor's 
      family because his brother married a heathen. The proposal to save her soul as laid down in the 
      'shaastor' is gratuitously provided by the lecherous Paachkori Mukhopadhyay who wishes to ravage 
      her for thirty nights as penance for her transgression of being violated by non-believers. Only
       then can Bhubonmoni regain her place as a brahmin and be reintegrated into society. Torn between 
       his efforts to ensure that his children are not treated as social pariahs and rescuing his sister 
       from the ravenous intentions of Paachkori, Krishnoshundor envisages the conniving Horihor as 
       heaven sent and falls into his trap. The novel creates a startlingly refreshing displacement 
       of the moral latitude enjoyed by the privileged male members of the times with potent 
       perspicacity. A translation from the original Bengali novel might not capture the depth and 
       scale of the many lives and worlds conceived by the author. Arunava Sinha effortlessly moves 
       between these peripheries effortlessly and demonstrates that in the hands of an adept translator, 
       a wonderful work can occupy similar spaces in the original as in the language of its translation.</p>

      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p class="content">When unspeakable tragedy befalls Bhubonmoni, a young widow, she must leave her village along with her brother, Krishnoshundor, and his family. Ensnared by the wily entrepreneur Nobokishore Dutta, they end up in an overcrowded depot near a port, soon to be packed into a ship sailing to Surinam, where they will be sold as sugarcane plantation slaves. But Fate has other plans. Bhubonmoni finds herself being led away from the port and her family to be stowed away in a secret location in Calcutta. Not too far away, a young rebel Shourendro is swept up by the ideas of the Brahmo Samaj. Meanwhile in Metiabruz, a shy musician Chondronath impresses the exiled Nawab of Lucknow with his art. None of them know it yet, but the stars are aligning despite overwhelming odds for them to meet under curious circumstances...Set against the vibrant background of late nineteenth-century Bengal, Debarati Mukhopadhyay's beautifully woven novel brings together the glory and the decadence of colonial times. Fast-paced and thrilling, with a lively cast of characters including historical figures such as Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, Rabindranath Tagore, and Dr Kadambini Ganguly, Chronicles of the Lost Daughters is an unforgettable saga</p>
