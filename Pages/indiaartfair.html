        <p> The best way to find modern and contemporary art from South Asia is through the India Art Fair, 
          which provides a unique access point to the region's vibrant cultural scene.
          The expo, which takes place yearly in New Delhi, the capital of India, honours contemporary South 
          Asia by fusing cutting-edge contemporary visual art with modern masters and regional artistic 
          traditions. <br> <br> The fair's programme, which places art and the artist's voice at its core, brings 
          together galleries and institutions, private foundations and arts charities, artists' collectives 
          and national museums, as well as cultural events and festivals, allowing local and international 
          audiences to engage in creative ways with the region's cultural history and development.
          The fair operates a year-round schedule of activities, including education projects, 
          artist commissions, and pop-up programmes, with the goal of boosting audiences for the arts in 
          India. The fair is committed to promoting arts education and professional development 
          opportunities.</p>
