    <h2>Black River (Nilanjana S. Roy) </h2>
    <h4>Review</h4>
    <p class="book-info contents">Black River by Nilanjana S. Roy is a noir mystery that takes the readers on a dark and fatalistic journey into a story of lost innocence which is coloured with immense grief. What happens to a father whose child's life is suddenly cut short? Does the final coming together of the pieces of the puzzle bring any sense of closure? Why do we consider murder to be the most unforgiving crime? The Yamuna, groaning with the burden of pollutants, flows through the city of Delhi and the story as the black river. It remains a silent spectator to the crimes that unfold on its banks and on its waters. But do human beings have the capacity to swallow everything like the river? Roy delves into these pertinent questions and charts out a narrative that sheds light on these questions of loss and grief.
    </p>

    <p class="extracontent">    
      The story begins with a vivid portrayal of a serene rural town where time seems to have come to a standstill. While the nearby capital city experiences rapid growth and change, Teetarpur remains anonymous and its inhabitants take solace in the mundane routines of their unimaginative lives. The author has crafted a seemingly idyllic paradise, where a murder would be the furthest thing from anyone's mind. So when a death occurs, it shatters the peace and raises many unanswered questions that rouses everyone from a state of listless slumber. Out of nowhere, chaos descends upon the community, disrupting the delicate balance of their lives. The entire town is forced to confront the unnatural tragedy that has befallen its residents. A small group of lethargic policemen are suddenly thrust into the spotlight, tasked with the arduous tasks of rounding up suspects and collecting evidence. Readers are taken on a thrilling journey of discovery, which leads to peeling back the layers of each character and revealing the truth behind the murder, in no small measure comparable to an intricately dramatic study of a police procedural. <br> <br>

      Crime fiction has often been a means of conveying socio-political commentary, and Nilanjana Roy's Black River is no exception. While the murder in the novel is shocking, the aftermath is even more unsettling. The crime disrupts the daily lives of characters like Chand, causing them to reflect on the past, while others like Rabia are forced to confront harsh realities they had been ignoring. Chaos has a way of revealing uncomfortable truths, and the novel meticulously follows this pattern. It presents a series of moments that expose harsh realities about life in one of the world's largest democracies and holds up a mirror to its readers, forcing them to rethink their position and place in Indian society. The work is interspersed with references to socio-historical events, with one such event being the Babri Masjid demolition. The narrative highlights the socio-political climate in which we live and forces readers to confront questions that they may have previously avoided. The novel also tackles issues such as mental illness, the plight of slum dwellers, Islamophobia, farmer's rights, women's safety, and the divide between the haves and have-nots. These issues are often dismissed by readers as being outside of their everyday reality, but the murder in the novel has a seismic effect, creating a ripple of uncomfortable questions for both the characters and the readers. <br> <br>

      The characters of Chand, Rabia, Badshah Miyan, and village sub-inspector Ombir Singh are well-rounded, and readers become invested in each character's journey throughout the narrative as the author weaves their lives together. We are afforded a glimpse into the emotional journey of the family left behind by the victim. Similarly, we also become voyeurs into the tumultuous life of the investigating officer, who is struggling with his own personal demons as he grapples with accusations of infertility and a marriage in shambles. As is common in police procedural novels, Ombir Singh must navigate a tangled web of political pressure and corruption. The plight of those who are relegated to the lowest rung of society, such as the initial suspect, who is dismissed even by the villagers gains considerable magnitude during the course of the narrative as his story turns into a harrowing tale of horror and loss, becoming one of the most compelling character arcs in the book. <br> <br>

      The latest novel from Roy forces us to wrestle with the concept of justice and examine the limits of mercy. By the end of the novel, we might even question our own assumptions about morality and justice, but the author accomplishes this feat in quite an adept manner, allowing readers to arrive at their own conclusions. Roy's matter-of-fact approach to sensitive issues and her success in avoiding a sententious tone enhances the potency of her message. She has accomplished to weave an extremely complex narrative web with the use of simple, unadorned language and that underscores the power of the narrative itself. Black River is all set to be recognised as one of the benchmarks of crime fiction, and, in particular, noir mysteries of our times.

      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p class="contents">In the village of Teetarpur, a few hours from the capital city of Delhi, Chand's 
        peaceful life is shattered as he is forced into a dangerous quest for justice.
        At the station house, the jurisdiction of which extends to Teetarpur and the neighbouring villages, 
        Sub-inspector Ombir Singh, who has known Chand's daughter Munia since she was born, wrestles with his 
        conscience and the vagaries of his personal life as the increasingly murky case unfolds under the 
        watchful eyes of the 'Delhi boy', SSP Pilania.      
        Meanwhile, in the rough bylanes of Bright Dairy Colony, Chand's old companions Rabia and Badshah Miyan 
        fight for their right to home and country as the politics of religion threaten to overwhelm their lives.
        Framed as a police procedural, Black River is fast-paced and relentless, yet tender and reflective, 
        in its exploration of friendship, love and grief.
        'A riveting murder mystery. A psychological thriller. A magnificent work of literary fiction. Roy 
        brings her formidable experience as a journalist to this story of crime in modern India. Black River 
        addresses a society unravelling in the midst of change, a brutal class divide, the terror of religious 
        strife, relentless violence against women—but it is also suffused with tenderness for the ordinary, 
        heroic decency of those who persist in abiding by different rules. Reading this novel is like holding a 
        prayer in one's hands.
        — Kiran Desai
