        <p>Each February, India Design ID, an initiative of Ogaan Media and the country's premier luxury design event, is held at New Delhi's expansive NSIC Grounds in Okhla. It is the biggest exhibition of the very finest in furniture, architecture, and interior design. The India Design ID Exhibit, which took place over five exciting days, from February 22 to February 26, 2023, featured expertly curated displays and iconic collections of furniture, lighting, interiors, kitchens, accessories, flooring, and home technology from well-known local and international brands. <br> <br>

          One of ID's most well-liked attractions this year was the thoughtfully organised Symposium programme with its aim to support and promote a love of design through presentations, panel discussions, interactive sessions, debates and dialogues. Among the notable speakers were Aman Nath, co-founder of Neemrana Hotels and author; Amit Syngle, MD and CEO of Asian Paints group; Arthur Mamou-Mani, Head of his own architectural business in London; Ashwini Desphande of Elephant Design; Manuela Gatto of Zaha Hadid Architects; and numerous others. ID excels in creating a language that combines Indian and global aesthetics. Given the presence of numerous reputable domestic and international brands at the display, it was one of the finest chances for exhibitors to interact, discuss, and explore design interventions and architectural concepts all under one roof. ID included established brands such as Oorja, Lladró, Jaipur Rugs, Asian Paints, Stonex; but also introduced new exhibitions and pavilions such as Hunar, Living Traditions, ID Symposium and ID Collectibles to encourage indigenous artists and brands, women ceramic artists, emerging and experimental designers who are shaping the architectural and interior design practices across India. <br> <br>
          
          The Head of Strategy and Curator of India Design ID who also curated the first ever ID Collectibles Pavilion, Misha Bains, perfectly described ID 2023 in the following manner, “This year's upcoming INDIA DESIGN ID 2023 presents global brands, concepts and renowned names from the field of interiors and architecture. Spearheading trends and charting new paths, ID 2023 speakers are award-winners, the top in their field from across the globe. This 11th edition is programmed to spotlight the best in design, craft and techniques from India and across the globe.”</p>
