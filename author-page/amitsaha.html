    <h2>Amit Kumar Saha</h2>
    <p><b>Amit Kumar Saha</b> focuses in his paintings on human figures in general and transgender figures in particular.
    His works delve into and empathetically depict the complex emotions and embattled lives of the transgender 
    subjects who, though historically an integral part of Indian society and culture, are seldom recognized as 
    such and rather treated with ambivalence at best and rejection at worst. Pushed to the peripheries of the 
    civil society and eking out a living in the harshest conditions, in the face of public fear, revulsion, and 
    ridicule, they have heroically struggled to carve out a niche for themselves in this brutally indifferent 
    world with atypical and exemplary pride, boldness, dignity and confidence. Sahas paintings thus bring forth 
    their zest for life and quest for respect and acceptance against all odds.</p>
    <h1 class="art-subtop">Dil Garden Ho Gaya/ On My way</h1>
    <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/DilGarden.jpg" alt="art image">
    <div class="img-info">
      <p>Dil garden ho gaya - 'Dil Garden Ho Gaya', Amit Kumar Saha , 
        2017
      </p>
      <p>Medium - oil on Canvas</p>
      <p>Dimensions - 36" X 54"</p>
      <p>2015</p>
    </div>
    <p>The work depicts three distinctly gendered subjects---a man in the centre, a transgender to his left and 
      a woman to his right---seated in a rickshaw with the Red Fort of Delhi in the distant background. Their 
      gender identity is suggested by their accentuated physical features: the man's muscular physique, beard 
      and moustache; the woman's long slender neck, prominent breasts and high cheek bones; and the transgender 
      passenger's stout physique, thick neck, 'masculine' facial texture and hands, large hips and absence of 
      visible breasts. While bodily features distinguish the latter two, 'feminine' clothes of both mark them 
      from the man. The man at the centre represents the male-centric society, where the male 'gaze' 
      (apparently concealed by sunshades here) sexually objectifies the women and the transgender people. 
      The woman and the transgender subject have half-closed eyes and sit slightly sideways away from the man, 
      as if averting or ignoring his possible gaze, while he simultaneously appears to be looking straight, 
      as if confronting and discomfiting the viewer with a steady gaze behind the sunglasses, thereby suggesting 
      the 'unsettling' effect the male gaze has over its female and transgender objects.</p>

      <h1 class="art-subtop">Together, Alone</h1>
    <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/Together-Alone.jpg" alt="art image">
    <div class="img-info">
      <p>Together, Alone , Amit Kumar Saha , 
        2018
      </p>
      <p>Medium - oil on Canvas</p>
      <p>Dimensions - 40" X 69"</p>
      <p>2018</p>
    </div>
    <p>The work depicts two sleeping nude transgender figures and a cat lying beside them. Strips of white 
      covering the bosom of one of the figures and the lower part of the cat, as well as the sheet covering the 
      lower halves of their bodies, do not so much conceal as hint at the (trans)gender identity of the subjects 
      as well as their pet. The legs of each, one bare and the other covered by socks---symbolic of 
      maleness---also indicate their androgyny. The serene expression of the two, together with the floral 
      patterns on the white sheets all around and over them, suggests that they are at peace with themselves 
      (at least in sleep), dreaming a life of hope and promise. Yet their emaciated bodies, with tonal 
      variations suggestive of numerous marks or scars, show their weariness from the day-day existential 
      struggle in a cruel world. Nevertheless, their togetherness---fostered by a sense of belongingness to 
      their distinct, marginalized community---amidst their social loneliness provides them succor and fortitude 
      to battle through their lives.</p>

      <h1 class="art-subtop">Reflection of Ardor</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/Reflection-of-Ardor.jpg" alt="art image">
      <div class="img-info">
        <p>Reflection of Ardor , Amit Kumar Saha , 
          2018
        </p>
        <p>Medium - oil on Mirror</p>
        <p>Dimensions - 16.5" X 12.5" X 7</p>
        <p>2018</p>
      </div>
      <p>This work depicts a series of seven mirrors reflecting the roles that transgender people can play or 
        aspire to play. While they are consigned to the periphery of the 'civil' society and often reduced to 
        eking out their living as beggars, street-entertainers and sex-workers, they can achieve far more than 
        the society deems them fit for. The work is an expression of hope and promise that life holds out for 
        them, if they are allowed the opportunity to realize their dreams, and the dignity to live as human 
        beings. The mirrors reflect the ardor with which they can overcome the gender binaries that locate them 
        outside the 'neat' categories of 'man' and 'woman', rather outside the gender-stratified society. 
        The images of their beaming faces with half-closed eyes, as if oblivious to the social conventions of 
        gender roles, exude confidence in and complacence with their varied roles such as that of a bride or 
        danseuse that is suggested by their elaborate attires and jewelry. The flowers in the background signal 
        the blissful ambience in which they lead their fulfilling lives.  </p>

        <h1 class="art-subtop">Fe-Male-Fusion</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/FeMale-Fusion.jpg" alt="art image">

        <p>Fe-Male-Fusion , Amit Kumar Saha , 
          2015
        </p>
        <p>Medium - oil on canvas</p>
        <p>Dimensions - 36" X 48"</p>
        <p>2015</p>
      </div>
      <p>The work with a revealing hyphenated title depicts three fashionably dressed transgender subjects 
        apparently posing for a photograph in a restaurant. The 'masculine' texture of their faces with a 
        hint of moustache; their long, slender, slim-fingered 'feminine' arms; their striking 'feminine' 
        poses and make-up; and, of course, their 'feminine' dresses---all reveal their gender ambiguity. 
        Their bright, colorful apparel, together with their stylish postures and serene expressions, 
        exudes at once the composure, flamboyance, ease, and confidence with which they carry themselves 
        in public places, deliberately disregarding, even defying, the curious, mocking, or disrespectful 
        public gaze they are constantly subject to. The otherwise empty restaurant may suggest the social 
        isolation and rejection that as much marks their lives as brings out their distinctive composite 
        androgynous identity in a world of gender binaries.</p>

        <h1 class="art-subtop">Intimate</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/Intimate.jpg" alt="art image">
      <div class="img-info">
        <p>Intimate , Amit Kumar Saha , 
          2016
        </p>
        <p>Medium - oil on canvas</p>
        <p>Dimensions - 66" X 36"</p>
        <p>2016</p>
      </div>
      <p>This painting depicts two standing transgender figures, one embracing the other. Their identical 
        clothes, together with their bodily appearance, highlight their shared gender ambiguity, while their 
        embrace suggests an intimacy borne out of their common identity. Their brightly colored and 
        floral-patterned dresses, stylish stilettos, kohl-lined eyes, shapely eyebrows, rouged cheeks, 
        painted lips and fingernails, photographic poses, and a hint of smile on their faces---all indicate 
        that they take delight in adorning and beautifying their bodies that are otherwise rejected as aberrant 
        and flawed by the society. Underlying this desire to look attractive is also a sense of comfort and ease 
        with their distinctly gendered bodies (and selves), as reflected in their expressive faces that are also 
        lit by hope and promise. Yet the scars of life-struggle against social ridicule and rejection are 
        ill-concealed in their rough hands and feet; the bare wall in the background as much signals their 
        loneliness as focuses the viewer's attention on them. Nevertheless, their intimacy provides the bulwark 
        of mutual support against the trials and tribulations of life.</p>

        <h1 class="art-subtop">Embrance</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/Embrance.jpg" alt="art image">
      <div class="img-info">
        <p>Embrance , Amit Kumar Saha , 
          2016
        </p>
        <p>Medium - oil on canvas</p>
        <p>Dimensions - 36" X 48"</p>
        <p>2016</p>
      </div>
      <p class="subtop-info">As the title, a combination of 'embrace' and 'trance', suggests, the work depicts three identically 
        dressed, entranced transgender subjects embracing each other to the point of being fused into a 
        composite whole. The two figures on the right and left with their smug, dreamy, half-conscious looks, 
        and the central figure with its face turned away from the viewer suggest that they are at once 
        unaffected by, even defiantly indifferent to, the social rejection that they face. On the left side 
        of the background, the partial view of Victoria Memorial, the iconic colonial-era building that often 
        defines the bustling cityscape of Kolkata, may represent the urban social world that they inhabit. Yet 
        the missing other half of this edifice on the right and the missing crowd on its sprawling lawns leaves 
        an empty, unpeopled space that suggests that this world where they are alienated is virtually 
        non-existent for them, or is seen as such by them. They are simultaneously within and outside this 
        world----in an existential limbo that mirrors their own gender indeterminacy. On the other hand, their 
        tight embrace and identical clothes represents their small, exclusive, close-knit community where they 
        find solace and support.
