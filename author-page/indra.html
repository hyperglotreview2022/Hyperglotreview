    <h1 class="art-top">Indira Halder</h1>
    <p>The world of Indira Halder is crowded with men and women who are depicted in muted colours. Her painting 
      reminds one of the forgotten art forms of the marginalised tribal lands. By drawing from these art forms 
      Haldar is able to bring these otherwise forgotten art into the public eye. She uses subdued colours and 
      white is often a primary colour.  The subjects of her paintings are ordinary moments like a group of women 
      gossiping. At times she is inspired by the natural landscape which abounds in animals and flowers. 
      But haldar's paintings show a knack for presenting the normal in a peculiar way which makes her viewers 
      question their own version of reality. 
    </p>

      <p>THEY ARE I, Indira Halder
      </p>
      <p>Medium - oil on Canvas</p>
      <p>Dimensions - 36" X 54"</p>
    </div>
    <p>In the daily humdrum of life, we as individuals carry on with our routine lives devoid of
      any sense of adventure. As each person goes about this monotonous existence, he is
      also a part of the larger horde of people who go about their lives as ants. In this crowd
      is it possible to delineate any particular individual? To stop and unfold their stories? Is
      this what life is all about? This composition of Indira Halder raises these questions to
      her viewers. The canvas is full of men apparently moving forward but is this truly
      progression? The artist has painted these men in blurred lines. Their faces look blank
      and there are no distinct markings to make anyone of them memorable. Black lines fill
      the bodies of these persons who are all dresses similarly and painted yellow. While
      yellow is a shade that would recall sunshine on a bright day the choice of shade by
      Halder evokes a sickly pallor which manifests into a larger commentary on the illness
      that lies beneath the veneer of monotony of human existence.</p>

      <p>THEY ARE II , Indira Halder
      </p>
      <p>Medium - Acrylic on Canvas</p>
      <p>Dimensions - 12" X 32"</p>
    </div>
    <p>Set against a deep red background; this painting depicts a group of women with
      their backs turned towards the viewers. There is no scope for progression in this
      world which looks backwards towards orthodoxy rather than appreciating traditional
      values. The women look similar with hair tied neatly into plaits. Hair which is left
      loose has been used to depict a sense of freedom across ages so this depiction of
      plaited hair evokes a sense of conformity and submission. This restrictive pattern is
      further emphasized by the rigid postures of the women. This composition draws the
      attention of the viewers to the uniformity in the presentation of these women who
      have no marked individual traits. This canvas is a symbol of a nameless existence
      where individuals are trapped with no hope for escape. Yet amidst all this
      repetitiveness, the artist has used traces of blue which calls to mind the flow of a
      river. It is vital that in all this stagnancy, there is space for subversion and
      movement.</p>

      <h1 class="art-subtop">BORDER</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/Border.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="img-info">
        <p>BORDER , Indira Halder
        </p>
        <p>Medium - Acrylic and collage on canvas</p>
        <p>Dimensions - 28" X 56"</p>
      </div>
      <p>This painting presents an undulating landscape which is covered with rich vegetation of
        creepers and colourful leaves. It is interesting that instead of using just green, the artist
        has used varied colours to paint the leaves. There is also a presence of scattered yellow
        flowers on the hills. Together these creepers with its leaves call to mind the prayer flags
        which is often found fluttering in the mountains of the Himalayan belt which is supposed
        to help the wind carry prayers to heaven. The most prominent colour in this painting is
        the use of red colour which symbolises the presence of blood and therefore life. There is
        a wall towards the bottom of the canvas whose purpose is to confine. This is a man
        made structure as seen in the use of vertical wood planks. But can nature ever be
        imprisoned? Even as the wall marks a border, an elephant makes its presence known
        while the creepers have managed to climb and cover the
        walls with its colourful leaves.</p>

        <h1 class="art-subtop">WORSHIP OF NATURE</h1>

        <p>WORSHIP OF NATURE , Indira Halder

        <p>Medium - Acrylic on canvas</p>
        <p>Dimensions - 18" X 36"</p>
      </div>
      <p>This composition presents two images, one where a group of women are gathered
        holding flower garlands and the other image presents a landscape with rocks and
        plants which has received the offering of flower garlands. The artist has used stark
        images mostly in black and white. The use of multiple colours is restricted to the
        depiction of flowers alone. Flowers are a symbol of natureâ€™s beauty and it also
        reflects happiness and joy. Flowers are used as offering to present in any form of
        worship. Hence it is vital that these flowers are offered not to any particular God
        rather it is offered to the landscape made of rocks and plants. Divine power can be
        felt most amidst beauty of creation and this canvas is an assertion of that thought. At
        the same time by depicting women and nature side by side the artist highlights
        women and environment as an embodiment of nurturing. While the lack of colour
        hints at a darker latent destructive force which lies with both women as well as
        nature.</p>

        <h1 class="art-subtop">GOSSIPING IN LEISURE MOMENT</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/Gossiping.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="img-info">
        <p>GOSSIPING IN LEISURE MOMENT , Indira Halder
        </p>
        <p>Medium - Acrylic on canvas</p>
        <p>Dimensions - 20" X 20"</p>
      </div>
      <p>Inspired by the primitive sculptures found as
        remnant of by gone civilisations, this painting is
        centred around three women who are seated on a
        platform. The artist has used clean lines to make
        the outlines of these female figures but beyond that
        we can only see shadow like markings. The only
        presence on colour is the distinct 'duppattas' of red
        and blue which give these figures a distinct
        feminity. Together the positioning of these three
        figures mirrors a famous image of Gandhi's three
        monkeys who represent the idea of avoidance of all
        forms of evil. Hence, it is perhaps ironical then that
        this painting captures a moment of idle gossip
        among women on a lazy afternoon. This gives a
        painting a satiric overtone. On the edge of the
        painting is a border which has a tribal motif which is
        made up of crude stick figures of human as well as
        animals together with two spear like arrows.
        Together this painting represents a merging of the
        contemporary with the primitive and the real with
        the surreal.</p>

        <h1 class="art-subtop">NATURE IN SPRING</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/NatureinSpring.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="img-info">
        <p>NATURE IN SPRING , Indira Halder
        </p>
        <p>Medium - Acrylic on canvas</p>
        <p>Dimensions - 20" X 20"</p>
      </div>
      <p class="subtop-info">This painting captures a moment in nature when
        everything comes alive. It depicts a group of trees set
        against a background of a lake with trees standing
        further away. The choice of colours used to represent
        landscape is interesting as the artist uses the muted
        colours of autumn. Yet this autumnal colours also
        gives a warm overtone to the painting. The trees are
        white dotted with black and they stand tall with minimal
        branches. The way they stand, bare with nothing much
        left paint a picture of their journeys and the storms that
        they have faced. In face of all trials and tribulations,
        they remain standing. Hence, it is a moment of joy to
        see that they are topped with a cluster of flowers and
        leaves and colours alike. In a landscape where
        everything is muted the burst of these colours
        captures the burst of life in the season of spring. The
        gentle and earthy colours of yellow and brown give
        way to pink, red and orange. The blossoming of these
        colours give a sense of hope and capture the cycle of
        renewal which is a vital part of nature.
