    <h2>Kuntal Dutta</h2>
    <p>The compositions of Kuntal Dutta have an air of magical realism. His sources of inspiration are real 
      life things that one would observe every day. He draws houses that are part of a town, a tree, a bird 
      or the moon which is a source of admiration for everyone. Yet the way he portrays these simple objects 
      gives his canvas a magical quality as his brushstrokes are not precise rather they create a haziness 
      which instead of distorting the picture gives it a surreal quality. He uses muted colours to paint this 
      dream like world where everything looks merged together yet everything creates its own
      separate impression. He has a knack for giving a magical quality to the commonplace while making 
      the magical a part of everyday life. In his artistic gaze the magical and the real merge to create a 
      tangible symphony. .

    <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/town6.jpg" alt="img">
    <div class="img-info">
      <p>TOWN 6, Kuntal Dutta
      </p>
      <p>Medium - Acrylic on Canvas</p>
      <p>Dimensions - 36" X 48"</p>
    </div>
    <p>This painting depicts a dwelling of a few houses by a river or a sea. The landscape
      is presented as a blur of yellow but one can still make out the outlines of the
      houses and the inhabitants living there. Towards the left is a dark blue blur which
      gives us the impression of a presence of a water body. On the background are faint
      hills which are curved with no jarring and sharp edges. The wind and water
      perhaps have eroded these edges over the years which indicate how ancient this
      landscape is. While these are commonplace aspects that we are all familiar with
      the one element that catches the eye of the viewer is the tiny triangles which
      create an effect of sparkle on the canvas. These tiny triangles are accompanied by
      star-like structures which add to this shine. The use of the colour yellow
      heightens this illusory quality by creating a sense of glow and warmth. Together
      this creates a magical space of illusion where reality disappears in the blur of the
      artist's brushstrokes.</p>

      <h1 class="art-subtop">TOWN 9</h1>
    <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/town9.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="img-info">
      <p>TOWN 9 , Kuntal Dutta
      </p>
      <p>Medium - Acrylic on Canvas</p>
    </div>
    <p>This painting draws a surreal picture of landscape and a moment caught in a
      state of limbo. There is no clear demarcation of where one house begins and
      where it ends as they seem to part of the earth. The trees encircle this space
      almost in a gesture of protection. On the sky the cloud is imagined in a way a
      child traces the clouds in a manifestation of innocence while the moon looks to
      be made up of several pieces all put together in a moment of neat harmony. The
       paths, stairs and even the grass all merge into the landscape. The use of shades of
      grey and blue give it an air of serenity and balance. Together this paining evokes
       an image of an oasis in a desert. Here is a creation of an oasis of peace and
      tranquility which has remained untouched by the hustle and bustle of the world
      outside. Yet there falls from the sky snow like flecks of white giving this
      painting a magical quality. In midst of an oasis in a desert, snow falls and along
      with it the dichotomy between real and magical collapse into nothingness and
      all that exist is symphony and beauty.</p>

      <h1 class="art-subtop">TOWN WITH FULL MOON</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/townwithfullmoon.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="img-info">
        <p>TOWN WITH FULL MOON , Kuntal Dutta
        </p>
        <p>Medium - Acrylic on canvas</p>
      </div>
      <p>This painting depicts a small dwelling with a few trees and plants set against the backdrop
        of a hilly landscape. The house has lost its structure as it becomes one with the landscape.
        The hills in the background stand tall surrounding the dwelling. The tree stand luminous
        and the ferns and the plants at the foothills are swaying which gives the painting a sense
        of movement. The grass is drawn in well defined brushstrokes evoking a presence of a
        gentle wind. But it is the moon and the sky that catches the attention of the viewers.
        Unlike the rest of the canvas which is painted in subdued colours, the sky is painted a
        vivid blue which captures the beauty and mystery of the vastness at night. The full moon
        shines its ethereal light coming so close to humans that it almost seems to be part of the
        landscape rather than the sky. The moon draws the attention of the viewers as it is not
        painted white, the usual colour we would associate with it. Instead it has been given a
        golden hue which gives it a surreal quality. Together, this canvas presents a magical space
        and is a celebration of the nightscape.</p>

        <h1 class="art-subtop">TOWN IN BLACK LIGHT</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/towninblacklight.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="img-info">
        <p>TOWN IN BLACK LIGHT , Kuntal Dutta
        </p>
        <p>Medium - Water colour</p>
        <p>Dimensions - 20" X 30"</p>
      </div>
      <p>This grayscale painting depicts a town with houses and a tree in its midst.
        Some of the houses are single storied whereas some give the impression of
        being double storied. We can make out pathways and stairs in this town and
        some vague occupants. The lack of bright colours creates an atmosphere of
        monotony and dreariness. Yet the use of grey, black and white emphasizes
        this faded landscape. Everything seems to overlap in this canvas as it gets
        difficult to separate the outlines of each object drawn by the artist. The artist
        invites his viewers to take a closer look as the house merge with what look
        like human faces. There is strangeness to both the houses and the faces
        which both lack any form of life. If the houses give an impression of lacking
        hearth than the faces look like they have forgotten the existence of their
        heart. Perhaps this painting calls to attention the muted existence of both
        humans and houses who are trapped in a daily grind in search of colours.</p>

        <h1 class="art-subtop">STILL LIFE WITH AN APPLE</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/stilllifewithanapple.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="img-info">
        <p>STILL LIFE WITH AN APPLE , Kuntal Dutta
        </p>
        <p>Medium - Water colour</p>
        <p>Dimensions - 10" X 15"</p>
      </div>
      <p>An apple lies at the center of a table being gazed by a man, a half
        empty bottle lies at the other side. The background depicts a stage
        with its curtains drawn open. There is faint glow of light as a
        viewer is given a slice of a cityscape. With the use of layers and
        dark and lighter colours, the artist creates a play of light as some
        objects are revealed under the spotlight while some give an air of
        mystery in darkness. There are no neat lines as things merge into
        each other and yet emerge from within these layers. But it is a
        single eye that looks on which recalls the all seeing eye of myths
        and fairy tales. the senses are stirred up in this canvas as we can
        imagine the hustle and bustle of this space with the bottle tipping
        over in some celebration or drowning in some sorrow. The faces
        blur in the background giving this painting an air of
        disjointedness. But it the ordinary apple which looks out of place
        in this mysterious surrounding. Yet it is this apple which is a
        symbol of temptation and seduction. Hence, it is the commonplace
        which manifests into the enticement of the cityscape.</p>

        <h1 class="art-subtop">STILL LIEF 2</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/stilllife2.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="img-info">
        <p>STILL LIEF 2 , Kuntal Dutta
        </p>
        <p>Medium - Water colour</p>
        <p>Dimensions - 10" X 15"</p>
      </div>
      <p class="subtop-info">There is a sense of austerity in this painting as the artist uses
        minimal and unadorned pieces as the object of his interest. The use
        of grey, black and blue create a dream like motif where the real
        can no longer be separated from the unreal. Like in a dream where
        if one reached out to hold something, it would disappear, the
        objects in this painting look intangible. There is a randomness to
        the way things are presented in this canvas but at the same time
        they look like pieces of puzzle waiting to be put together to form a
        larger narrative. Each object has made a singular journey and
        together they celebrate the joy of diversity. One can no longer
        make out the structure of these objects as they have lost their
        rigidity. Is it a bottle or a flower vase, a tea cup or even a slice of
        fruit? No can make out. This painting reflects transience of
        everything, be it grand narratives or the little things. Nothing can
        escape the onslaught of time as everything fades into nothingness
        even memories.

      <h1 class="art-subtop">BIRD DRAWING</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/birddrawing.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="img-info">
        <p>BIRD DRAWING , Kuntal Dutta
        </p>
        <p>Medium - Ink on Paper</p>
      </div>
      <p class="subtop-info">A black bird lies at the center of the painting evoking a sense of foreboding. There
        is an element of mystery and darkness of a bird caught in mid flight. It looks like
        the bird is battling a storm and it is flying across a turbulent sea. The play of white
        and black at the bottom half of the canvas reflect a presence of water as the lines
        drawn across capture the movement of this tempest. The artist has filled the
        painting with haphazard lines which can be symbolic of the turbulent mind as
        well. In this moment of thunderstorm, this bird has no hope for a respite. There
        are no trees in the picture or even a stone to rest its weary wings. Instead it is
        exposed to the harsh elements with no protection. Yet what is fascinating is that in
        spite of all the odds against it, the bird is still in mid flight, it is not painted in a
        moment of defeat. There is a sense of joy in all the shades of darkness in this
        picture especially the light of the eye that the artist has captured. Truly, the bird
        will ride this storm.

      </p>

      <h1 class="art-subtop">BIRD DRAWING 2</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/bird2.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="img-info">
        <p>BIRD DRAWING 2 , Kuntal Dutta
        </p>
        <p>Medium - Ink on Paper</p>
      </div>
      <p class="subtop-info">A bird is caught, a bird that is meant to be free. The multiple lines
        across the painting give an impression of a snare that has been successful in
        entrapping this bird. The bird looks on in fright as the artist captures the fear and
        turmoil of this creature. The use of black emphasizes this fear and violence that
        one can perceive in this picture. This is further emphasized by the random lines
        which hint at a larger chaos. There is disorder and chaos in this picture which is
        hard to miss. But black is also a colour of mourning and loss which indicates the
        story that can be imagined. Violence often gives way to loss as that is the way of
        life. But black is also a symbol of protest. Here, this bird is caught and trapped but
        is still spreading its wings even in this claustrophobic space. This evokes an image
        of a phoenix rising, for it is only when everything burns down to ashes that a new
        phoenix can be born. Hence, myth and reality combine in this narrative to retell a
        story of oppression as well as hope.
