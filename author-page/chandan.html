    <p>The compositions of <b>Chandan Das</b>  are journeys of self reflection into the shadows of our minds as well 
      as into the light of happiness. His paintings are minimalistic in nature as he does not crowd his canvas 
      with too many things. Yet by using broad brushstrokes, just a few colours and a clever play of light and 
      shadows he is able to depict the various emotions that man goes through with the passage of time. His use 
      of colours is significant as they manifest into various emotions of anger, desire, loss, pain and joy. 
      Many a times he shows human mind and soul drowning in the darkest of sensations. But his works eventually 
      evoke a sense of hope as the dichotomy of light and darkness in an individual is not suppressed rather it 
      is celebrated in his art.</p>

      <p> EMOTION OF MYSELF 1 , Chandan Das , 
        2010

    <p>The canvas gives the impression of a ball
      of fire bursting out in a moment of
      combustion. The strokes of brush are
      used in such a way as though something
      is pushing its way outside. This brings to
      mind emotions of anger and frustration,
      a need to give voice to things which
      have remained suppressed till this
      moment of combustion. But this initial
      hint at negative emotions give way to
      positivity as one moves the eyes from
      the outside of the canvas to the centre of
      the painting. The two primary colours
      used in this canvas are red and yellow
      both associated with fire as well as
      sunshine. This itself hints at the idea of
      destruction as well as nourishment.
      Both fire and sunshine has the power to
      destroy yet both has the ability to
      nurture and give life. There is a flow of
      energy in this painting which is
      captured by the red which gives way to
      yellow. Fire gives way to a mellow
      version of happiness and vitality. Hence,
      this burning moment is a symbol of self-
      affirmation and progression.</p>

    <p>Can light exist without darkness? How do
      we know what is goodness if we have not
      experienced evil? This piece dwells on these
      questions as the canvas reflects the play of
      light and darkness. Good and evil can be
      seen as two sides of the same coin, one
      cannot be present in the absence of other.
      The colours used in this canvas are yellow,
      brick red, blue and black but these colours
      are not distinct in the painting rather they
      look fused together as each colour gives
      way to another one. This implies a lack of
      separation and segregation between the
      ideas of goodness and darkness which is
      symbolized by the use of yellow and black
      in the painting. While the use of yellow
      symbolizes vitality and happiness, the use of
      black recalls sadness and alludes to a larger
      tragedy. Each individual has goodness and
      evil, light and darkness within himself and
      this painting captures this duality of soul.
      But what is interesting in this painting is
      that it can be observed that there an
      impression of face with a wide mouth
      caught in the act of swallowing the darkness
      which lies at one corner. Perhaps like all
      happy endings, there is hope that goodness
      will triumph evil eventually.</p>

        <p> EMOTION OF MYSELF F , Chandan Das , 
          2010
        </p>
        <p>Acrylic On Canvas</p>
        <p>Dimensions - 40" X 48"</p>
        <p>2010</p>
      </div>
      <p>The canvas invites the viewers to go into the
        deeper brushstrokes of the painting recalling
        the inner landscape of the mind. In the centre
        is a cave-like space which gives an impression
        of a secret intimate space which has hitherto
        remained hidden. Each individual has such
        dark spaces in their souls which is reflected in
        this painting. This dark centre is encapsulated
        by two colours of blue and red, while the
        brushstrokes painting the colour red is
        smoother, the blue merging with white is
        harsher and separated. This recalls fire, the
        flames of which cannot be separated vs the
        blocks of ice. Fire and ice, energy and calmness
        merge in this painting to create an environment
        of balance—a moment of peace. This piece
        beckons its viewers into a moment of
        introspection as the painting moves inwards
        towards the centre where the colours no longer
        retain its distinctiveness. This piece hints at a
        possibility of serenity which can be born when
        balance of emotions is achieved.</p>

        <h1 class="art-subtop">EMOTION OF MYSELF 4</h1>
      <img class="artist-page-img" src="../author-img/EmotionofMyself04.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="img-info">
        <p> EMOTION OF MYSELF 4 , Chandan Das , 
          2010
        </p>
        <p>Acrylic On Canvas</p>

      <p>In a dark well-like space of the mind and soul, this
        painting presents a glowing ball of light, dull but very
        present. In the journey of life, there are so many ups
        and downs that sometimes it seems impossible to keep
        track of it. In moments like these everything collapses
        into chaos as one enters a dark tunnel. The use of blue
        in this painting which merges with black recalls this
        descends into this state of chaos. The painting gives the
        impression of a tunnel like space which symbolizes this
        descent and collapse that marks the human soul.
        Emotions can be turbulent and this inner turmoil is
        captured in the vivid blue which turns into a duller
        shade and eventually merges into black at the centre of
        the canvas. Blue brings to the mind the calmness of the
        ocean but here this blue could be a reference to sadness
        which gives way to darker thoughts as denoted by the
        use of black. Yet in this landscape of disorder and
        confusion the presence of the glowing ball of light
        stands out as a symbol of hope and joy. It is vital that
        this light is presented in such a way that it is ascending
        amidst the darkness which beckons a moment of
        rejoicing as the cheer of triumph over turmoil prevails.
