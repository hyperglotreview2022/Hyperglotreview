    <p>Nature and mankind collapse into each
      other in this piece as this sculpture refers
      both to living breathing objects as well as
      manmade inanimate objects. The iron nails
      form the base of this piece which refers to
      a creature which looks like it is part of the
      moist earth. The metal which changed the
      face of civilizations with its strength is
      combined with the nail whose purpose is to
      hold things together. So what is the purpose
      of these nails which are just hammered in
      at random? The folds of the sculpture part
      to reveal a creature with marks resembling
      a lowly worm. The worm which spends its
      life underground lives and dies an
      unremarkable life yet the combination of
      the iron nails with this creature hints at the
      innate strength and power of even the
      lowliest of creations. The use of earthy tones
      combined with the use of bright red of the
      sun works to symbolize the coming together
      of earth and metal. Together they reflect the
      undeniable force of the elements.</p>

    <p>At a first glance this sculpture evokes the image of
      a pen stand with a feather and an ink pot. It is an
      everyday object perhaps from a bygone era but
      one which is still retained in the minds of the
      viewers. It is also a stationary object but the
      feather seems to be fluttering in the wind creating
      a sense of movement. This movement also brings
      to mind the sails of a ship holding its own against
      strong winds. This piece has a weathered look
      with the irregular waves which mimic the image
      of a sail which has been on numerous journeys
      and has borne a silent witness to innumerable
      stories. The choice of the muted colours further
      reinforces the idea of a quiet and innate strength.
      While the curve of the feather like sculpture
      expresses the presence of an opposing force which
      stands in the way of any possible movement of the
      object. The fact that the sculpture still stands
      emphasizes an intrinsic strength in the face of the
      any resistance. This dichotomy of mobility vs
      immobility is what makes this sculpture an
      interesting piece.</p>

      <p>This piece represents a union of flora and
        fauna, a combination of the calmness and
        persistence of a tree and the unpredictable
        fire of a dragon like creature. It gives the
        impression of a tail of a dragon like creature
        full of blades entering into the depths of the
        earth yet it also evokes the image of a
        formidable tree with its branches spreading
        out. The piece is also full of oval shaped
        objects at regular intervals. This recalls the
        picture of an egg which holds life within it,
        perhaps the egg of the dragon like creature at
        the same time it looks a pine cone which
        falls to the ground in the autumn season as
        life diminishes from it. If we see the tree, it
        represents an unyielding force which keeps
        it grounded and if we see the dragon like
        creature we see the indomitable force which
        keeps it in motion. Hence, this piece has a
        mythical quality to it where both the tree
        and dragon like creature combine in a classic
        combination of the elemental fire and earth
        creating a new form of cosmic force.</p>

      <p>This piece comprises of multiple circles connected
        together at seemingly random points. Beginning
        with the largest circle at the base it ascends towards
        the heaven as the circle gets smaller with each
        connection. While circle denotes infinity there is
        a sense of finiteness in this piece especially if one
        considers the use of colours. The largest circle at the
        bottom is full of vivid colours drawn which sharp
        and confident strokes. This represents a sense of
        energy perhaps of a hot headed youth. The second
        circle is slightly smaller and here the vivid colour
        of red is m aking way for the subdued and dull
        colour at the centre. Perhaps life like the colour red
        is ebbing away as youth is fading away. The top
        most circle is also the smallest. Here, the absence
        of any bright colour is glaring. Life has completed
        its journey and we have come to the end where
        brightness has made way for a calm and pale cream.
        There are no sharp strokes of colours and everything
        just flows into a sort of drabness waiting to reach
        higher plane. Birth and death move hand in hand
        and life has come full circle in this piece.</p>

      <p> Does man mimic nature? Are manmade objects inspired by the innumerable elements found in nature? 
        We can find our answer in this piece titled seaweed which evokes the image of a ship. The structure 
        rises with each fold resembling a hull, mast and sails of a ship. This is topped with a structure which 
        strongly resembles a look out of a ship with its occupants gazing at the unending ocean. The vivid blue 
        and green with a splash of red reminds the viewer of the serenity of the ocean combined with the renewal 
        of green. The use of red adds the element of energy to this piece. We often associate red with fire and 
        anger but in this piece the use of red add to the overall harmony reflecting a primal force rather than 
        a destructive and violent force. The seaweed like structure lies on what resembles a creature from the 
        sea. The smooth line of this creature and the curve recalls a Viking ship further reinforcing the idea 
        of how man mimics nature. This piece is a symbol of the knowledge and inspiration found in nature.
